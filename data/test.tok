" When I was a kid , I totally loved both Bill & Ted Movies . The other night , Bogus Journey was on and since it was at least 5 years since I last saw it , I decided to tune in . AND I LOVED IT ALL OVER AGAIN ! This film is still funny after all those years . ' Excellent Adventure ' is better , but this one rocks just the same . Sure , some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy , but hey , this entire film is cheesy in a cool way . Plus it features the coolest personation of Death ever in a movie ! Concluding : Totally like non bogus movie dude ! Way Excellent ! STATION ! ! ! , " positive
" This movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people . There are only three locations ( the school , the store , and the coach 's house ) that are really used . It 's primarily at the coach 's house , however . A movie doesn 't need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itself.Four friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up . One is rich , important , and has no real love outside of money . One wants to be mayor again , but his competition is turning him sour . One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family . One is a traveling alcoholic.First off , I love the actors in this film . They 've all been household names to me . They proved their worth here.One of the most pivotal moments is when Tom , played by Gary Sinise , blows up on the coach . He yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game . His blows the coach 's whistle and yells back his catchphrases - " " Forgive me Father , for I have sinned ! " " It 's amazing to watch , with energy that just chills you.Highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesn 't need shiny effects to interest them . , " positive
" Virginal innocent Indri finds herself at a house of prostitution run by ruthless pimp MG . Indri winds up incarcerated in MG 's private prison after she refuses to make love to him . Of course , Indri and worldly top con Helga join forces and plan to escape . Maman Firmansyah 's blah , uninspired direction and Piet Burnama 's dull , talky script thoroughly undermine any trashy vitality this flick needs in order to qualify as a pleasing piece of babes-behind-bars exploitation junk : the sluggish pace painfully drags throughout , there 's no gratuitous female nudity whatsoever ( the girls don 't even show any skin during the obligatory group shower scene ! ) , the expected torture and degradation are both extremely tame and tepid , the moderate crummy gore likewise fails to impress , and even a ridiculous catfight sequence ain 't nothing to get excited about . Thomas Susanto 's pedestrian cinematography , the laughably lousy dubbing , the excruciatingly overlong 102 minute running time , the sappy theme song , and Gatot Sudarto 's cornball score add further abject insult to already appalling injury . Only some decent last reel break-out action offers a little relief from the otherwise overly abundant stultifying tedium . A complete yawn-inducing dud . , " negative
" This movie has got to be one of the worst I have ever seen make it to DVD ! ! ! The story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that I highly caution parents on .... But the story line is like a loose cannon . If there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker-this one would have sprung from that.It reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960 's , poor script writing and filming . The only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver . The rest of the film , could have easily been made by middle school children . I give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated . My advice-Don 't Watch It ! ! ! , " negative
" While all of the Fleischer / Famous Studios " " Superman " " cartoons are excellent , " " Billion Dollar Limited , " " the third in the series , is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation , plot , and pacing . Why it wasn 't even nominated for an Oscar as Best Animated Short for 1942 ( Incredibly enough , only the first one was ) in inexplicable.Here , Lois Lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the U.S. Mint . Masked gangsters in their super-powered ( for 1942 ) car take off after the train , determined to get that gold . Without giving too much away , what ensues is a thrill ride for both the characters and the audience , with truth , justice , and Superman triumphant at the end.As they did in all the Fleischer / Famous Superman cartoons , Clayton " " Bud " " Collyer and Joan Alexander , who played Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane on radio , have the voice work honors here , and Fleischer perennial Jack Mercer gets a little to do as one of the bad guys , as well . , " positive
" Great movie in a Trainspotting style ...

" Is Miike like Chabrol , alternating art with dreck , sometimes confusing the two ? Does he match the fifty / fifty rate some claim for Chabrol ? Do we see here too much or too little Miike ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I don 't know . But I could easily fill ten lines just citing Chakushin ari 's ( One Missed Call 's ) steals , allusions , and clichì±•s . Others here will hit on most of them , though not perhaps Ochiai 's Saimin ( Hypnosis ) for the sleazy telecast taunting things supernatural . Only once , when Yumi takes the zombie-like mother in her arms , did One Missed Call startle me a little.One other point of interest : Renji Ishibashi ( looks like Christopher Walken ) as the detective . Ishibashi in Audition 's abusive back story , and as Dead or Alive 's Boss Aoki of the vat of excrement drowning and more , may be the most convincingly evil character actor I 've ever seen . So here he 's a cop . , " negative
" When I first viewed this movie , I didn 't know the title of it . I realized it had Chevy Chase in it with the same name he had in Caddyshack so I had an idea this was Caddyshack 2 . At the end of the movie when I did find out it was Caddyshack 2 I was disappointed . They could have done better . Dan Akroyd I thought was bad . The whole story was bad . Call this movie by another title , but don 't call it Caddyshack 2 . You give that great movie a bad name . Jackie Mason 's daughter when I first saw her looked like his wife . How old is this girl ? Geez . How about making this movie a little believable . I thought Chevy Chase was good . , " negative
" Margaret Mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess ! Fine costuming and sets can 't even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by Joanne Whalley ( as the title character ) and the ever-bland Timothy Dalton ( as Rhett ) . Even worse than the acting--and perhaps partially explaining it--is the script , which is astoundingly cliched and predictable . Add to that hellishly bad script a score that 'll have you cringing , and you 've got a disaster I wouldn 't wish on any viewer . SCARLETT is just amazingly lousy , and I can 't imagine how it ever got made , much less made it to video . , " negative
" Wow . They told me it was bad , but I had no idea.We 've started a tradition . We found one copy of this movie , and we just pass it from person to person . Whoever has the movie watches it , and then passes it to someone else deemed worthy of seeing this unique , creative , horrible movie . Hopefully it 'll travel ' round the world a few times.It 's painful . Really painful . It 's even beyond so bad it 's funny . Well , okay , sometimes it 's so bad it 's funny . But most of the time it just gives you that feeling that there 's something sucking at your brain from the inside.Wow. Watch it , then pass it . , " negative
" Wow , I loved this film . It may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch . The tale revolves around this one family from Utah and it 's the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch . The main lead ( Giovanni Ribisi ) plays his part very well , at no time does he leave you to believe that he 's acting all his feelings . It 's his brother ( Elias Koteas ) who stole the show for me though . When the two were in scenes together they bounded their lines off of each other , giving fantastic performances . Great cast , great film . , " positive
" One hilarious thing I 'll say off the top , is I 'm not the biggest Seisun Suzuki fan . I 've actually seen a fair number of his works ( thanks to a retrospective the film festival had ) and I found his films just a wee too Yakuza-driven for my tastes . So , I went into Princess Raccoon wary of what I was going to see . Boy ! Was I knocked out ! ' Raccoon ' is Suzuki 's attempt at a musical , using the elements of Japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements ( both Audial and Visual ) , Raccoon is a treat from start to finish . The lead actor , Joe Ogdari , proves that he 's one of the hottest actors in Japan these days in this role . I have to admire that the younger Japanese actors still take roles that take place in Feudal-times Japan , dressing up in Samurai gear to full effect . The story itself does get a bit confusing , if you don 't follow it really closely , but even if you don 't , prepare yourself for the treasures that Princess Raccoon has . , " positive

" There is nothing like an Oscar Wilde comedy , and this movie is nothing like a comedy . The melodrama labors from scene to scene and the comedy is completely absent . In the original story , the humor comes from the Americans who are oblivious to the ghostly traditions of Canterville Chase . The American father even offers some oil to the ghost to quiet the creaking chains . Read the book ! , " negative
" This show is sheer entertainment and doesn 't try to be a Greek drama . It certainly contains elements of one what with all the plot twists , but it 's immensely engaging and fun . Las Vegas is the perfect setting for a show and they will certainly never have a lack of material to work with ! Anything and Everything DOES happen there ! The actors in this show are extremely personable and you really do want to see what they are up to and into each week . The show is also very funny . The humor arises from the characters and situations . Not just thrown in gratuitously . It 's a well-crafted show in that regard . It certainly makes me look forward to Friday nights and I 'm glad I now own the first two seasons on DVD ! , " positive
" This show is the worst show ever ! Norris and his family write it , produce it , direct it , etc etc . The only reason I ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it . How many times can Norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain ? No trees , no building , just whoosh ..... thin air . He ALWAYS solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is . No co star ever gets the glory . Its all Norris . Its truly apparent that Norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content . Terrible acting , terrible script , terrible series . , " negative
" " " The Ladies Man " " suffers a common problem among movies based on " " Saturday Night Live " " skits . And that is , a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes . Although this movie does have its laughs , like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps , a sex-maniac straight out of the ' 70s , and Will Ferrell as a wrestling-obsessed husband cuckolded by Leon . So this movie is funny enough , but it 's no " " Wayne 's World " " ! , " positive
" This film is full of interesting ideas . Some scenes are truly hilarious . The dialogs are witty and colloquial . The tension in the film comes not so much from the ' murder mystery ' plot as from the relationship between the characters . The film tells two stories in parallel.The first story involves the characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz . Trintignant is an ageing drifter , with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness , who is followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with plenty of good-natured smiles . Many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters , for example when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to be intimidating.The second story tells how a salesman , played by Jean Yanne , gives up his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend . Yanne plays the part with a kind of aggressive irony . I wish I could describe this better.After a while the viewer understands how both stories are connected and they meet indeed in the end , in a surprising but also logical ending.The film is a successful mixture of the witty but superficial gangster films the director 's father ( the celebrated Michel Audiard ) used to write , and the " " typical french film " " with lots of psychological depth and lots of care in the display of emotions . , " positive
" What is it with Americans and their hang-up with religious gobbledy-gook ? To think this was a best-selling novel is incredible , but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers . In this case , all the good actors have gone to heaven and we 're left with Kirk Cameron as a CNN-type journalist ( ! ) trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared . Oh yeah , there 's a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine , or something . The good news is that this is done so cheaply , and with such inane dialogue , that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its unintended laughs . Not recommended for anyone with a 3-digit IQ . , " negative
" OK enough already. this is a terrible piece of television. the camera work is appalling ( do i have to remind you of the crunchy gravel so loud you can hardly hear the actors speak ) lady bertram has the most annoying voice in the entire world. anna massey is ' acting ' in such an unbelievable fashion. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is beyond beyond. also the bertram girls aren 't pretty enough , and the guy playing henry crawford is awful. to say the camera work is dodgy is an understatement. i watched this adaptation over Christmas , and i think under any other circumstances i would not have been able to endure this , and certainly would have not been able to justify the wasted time.i am a fan of faithful to jane adaptations. so i could not bear the film adaptation or the recent pride and prejudice movie. but see any other adaptation instead , even emma is better than this . , " negative
" Possibly the worst film within the genre in existence . It was announced as a comedy , but is simply tragically pathetic . I don 't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to . It is toilet humour at its very poorest , I would avoid even watching the trailer . I only went to see it because it was announced that if you like Monty Python , you are bound to love this . Whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged . I am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement . Rarely do I leave the cinema , really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me : this one did it in just 30 minutes . , " negative
" Awful ! Despite the good performance of Ed Harris , Diane Kruger , and the strong budget ( the reason for the 3 stars ) , the movie is by far the worst I saw about a composer , and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music . I agree with some fictional stuff to upgrade a biography , that otherwise couldn 't be so " " charming " . " This was done in AMADEUS with best results , but this B copy here is a flaw . Beethoven had a strong personality , but was a sensible artist . Here in this movie however , he looks much more as Mike Tyson ! I wonder also , whether despite his deafness , he heard all the whisperings in the last scenes ( may be a cochlear implant ? ) . I prefer to listen to the ninth on a CD with some nice maestro . Today most of them conduct modern Wagnerian orchestras . By the way : I gave Amadeus 10 / 10 ! , " negative

I would definitely recommend this movie ! ! Nancy : " " I wonder why those guys were trying to kill us ? ! " " Corky : " " Yeah , I was wondering that too . Actually , it 's kinda creeping me out !

" I wanted to love this movie . How could I not love it ? Cary Grant , Jayne Mansfield , Stanley Donen ; all icons in their own way . However , the train wreck that was Suzy Parker ruined the entire experience for me . Her acting was so appalling that I sat there with my jaw hanging open , not believing my eyes or ears . I could barely make it through one viewing , THAT 'S how hideous she is in this.Cary ? Gorgeous and in fine dramatic form . Jayne ? Adorable , endearing , and obviously having a ball . The supporting cast does alright , and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning , retro elegance.Then you see Suzy Parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness , a deadness , a cluelessness that simply defies belief . Who told this creature she could ACT ? ? Oy VEY , people . , " negative
" Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany . Brando 's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable . The plot is inane and laughable ( not comic ) . The other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity ... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard . Everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful . The director throws freeze-frame and slow-motion shots about with impunity . The incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect . It 's not something I really look for in a movie , but even the wardrobe was way off . The venerable Brando couldn 't take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in . I 've heard this movie called " " David Lynch-esquire " " and " " irreverently funny " ... " it is neither . David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film was in no way creative . And don 't confuse irreverence with stupidity . , " negative
" Jake Speed ( 1986 ) was an amusing parody of Indiana Jones and other adventurer films that were popular during the eighties . Wayne Crawford stars as Jake Speed , an adventurer who 's always battling evil doers wherever he goes . With his assistant Desmond Floyd ( Dennis Christopher ) they globe trot looking for some action ( and some decent story lines ) . The duo meet a young woman named Margaret ( Karen Kopins ) who 's sister has been kidnapped by an evil white slaver trader ( John Hurt ) . Can she find and convince Jake and Desmond to help her rescue her sibling ? A sappy and cheesy film that doesn 't pretend to be something that it 's not . I have to give this one a recommendation . That 's if you enjoy movies that like to have fun and for those who don 't take everything at face value.Recommended. , " positive

Watching this I was wondering why anyone would want to see this since Zeta-Jones ' character is so unlikable . Come on she 's so obsessed with cooking and being the best all she does is cook for her therapist or talk about food . Ugh . I won 't use any of the numerous puns that come to mind .

" I was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in " " Dear John , " " but it was very slow moving ; and I felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers . I usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels . Ironically , I did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action.The cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters , focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter . I felt that Channing Tatum became bogged down in what became a very " " hang-dog " " series of expressions in response to loss . , " negative
" I have two very major complaints regarding this film.1. That my local rental store shelved what is very clearly a soft core porn in the " " suspense " " category . ( Had I known what it was , I would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place . And yes , this movie is a soft core porn . ) 2 . The title has nothing to do with the movie . No one in this movie does anything that is either deviant or obsessive , let alone a combination of the two.Actually , make that three major complaints : 3 . That I for some reason watched the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list . Boy do I regret that . Stay away from this movie . Learn from my mistake . This movie is valueless on virtually every level . , " negative
" Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept ? I can think of plenty that equal this one , but none which manage to outdo it . The cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue . I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this . Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot , but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career . Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don 't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this . Avoid , it 's obviously a style of film that Americans haven 't really got a grasp of . Watch the final result if you must , and you 'll see what I 'm talking about , but DON 'T say I didn 't warn you ... , " negative
" This is one of my 3 favorite movies . I 've been out on the water since I was 13 , so I got a lot of the humor as well as recognizing a lot of the near-land scenery ( the movie , although taking place in and around Virginia , was filmed around the San Francisco Bay ) , most notably the mothball fleet just east of the Benicia Bridge where Kelsey Grammar 's character was first introduced to the USS Stingray , and the piers of San Francisco at the very end of the movie ( including a boat that I 've worked on ) . As other people have said , the actors appeared to have fun making this movie as well as making it entertaining . The line " " We 're approaching the bottom , sir ! I can hear a couple of lobsters duking it out " " is , at least to me , priceless.I am one of numerous people who is anxiously awaiting a letterboxed DVD of Down Periscope to be introduced . , " positive
" Horrible , horrible TV show ! Why Comedy Central decided to repeat old episodes of this program is beyond me . It really sucks ! I am , of course , speaking about the seasons after the first two . The first two seasons were golden , and if I was exclusively talking about those seasons , this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars . None of the comedians appearing after the first two seasons who were not part of the original cast are any good . They were , and are , awful . The comedy is not funny at all . AT ALL ! ! ! The original cast was full of very talented comedians , like Artie Lange , Phil LaMarr , and Mary Schorr ( or whatever her name is ) , all of whom should have gotten better deals after they left MAD TV . This show is highly overrated , and less worthy of your channel surfing time than Saturday Night Live , another horrible show . Go out on Saturday night and have fun , and leave MAD TV to wither and die , as it deserves to . , " negative
" Though some would prefer to comment on the value of Bond movies in the connection of learning frequency , and while most of the jargon that tends to limit Bond to a meager 007 following has been exploited beyond all reasonable contention , there are several redeeming plausibilities that extend the credibility of Sean Connery in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance by Jessica Tandy in Driving Miss Daisy . While Connery had been less visible in the latter , his woman-seeker qualities had maybe not cast a frown on the face of embittered spectators as it would in this latest rendition which , to most involved , approached the 007 theme with kind resentment , albeit while the general flavor had been altered . Great for those who interest others while faking to be who you 're not ! , " negative
" My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did ( get us in ) . This is " " our movie " " and the music is " " our songs " . " Michelle 's song is " " our " " song . Yeah , nowadays , it 's a crime to show naked children on the screen , but we were screwing at 16 , why not these kids ? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl , then rich dad steals him away from her at the end , after she gives birth under impoverished conditions . She is left alone with child . It is a love story and a " " growing up " " story . The music is fantastic , and the story is one any person could relate to . May be someday this will be released on DVD . , " positive

" Now my friends , films like " " La Bì±—te " " ( aka " " The Beast " " or " " O Monstro " " ) only can be done in the old continent : ) , in this film we see all : horses dirty sex , nymphomaniac kind off gorilla , non sense dialogs , etc , etc , etc ... In the serious terms now , its an allegory , that men sometimes could be bestial , visceral and brutal , Walerian Borowczyk ( the director ) shows us the loss of innocence , sexual violence , rape and brutality .

" First of all , Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie , and she 's just awful . This movie has every horror move clichì±• in imagination , and all badly played .

The virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films . The dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool . It 's almost like you 're wishing that they 'd all die sooner . I saw the rough cut of this film a while ago , but somehow , this just got worse .

" This is actually a trilogy of 3 of Somerset Maugham 's short tales . The first one is The Verger , which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable . After 17 years Albert Foreman is laid off from his church job because he can 't read nor write . So what does he do ? Opens a tobacco shop , of course ! The second is Mr. Know-All which was actually a story I had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten , until I heard the familiar introduction . Another 15 minute one , and also very good . It worked better on film than in a book for me , but then perhaps that 's because I was only 14 the last time , afterall.The 3rd one is nearly a let-down . Almost an hour in length , it simply drags . It 's not all that bad , but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 . I watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour , and found that it still made sense and really I hadn 't missed a thing ! Overall I give them 8 , 9 , and 6 out of 10 , respectively . , " positive

I saw it on lifetime , and it 's in the same entertaining class as films like : ' The Betty Broderick Story ' , ' Locked Up : A Mother 's Rage ' , etc .... { which , by the way , are also very good , entertaining films ! } It 's an over the top drama , about a single mother who tries to break away from her middle-class , predictable personality . This movie is just pure entertainment ! It doesn 't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction . But , it does show how any " " regular " " middle class person can ( & they do ! ) get addicted to heroin . Junkies aren 't just homeless uneducated people on the street . { By the way , if you do watch it , check out how the kid bosses his mother around ! Spoiled ! } 8 out of 10 stars . , " positive
" MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch . He 's a modern genius , because he 's not only a film-maker . His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen . So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me , with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets . Still , Lynch is there , and , while this is far from his best , it 's a film not to be missed . Late Richard Farnsworth 's performance is one of the reasons.8 / 10 , " positive
" Wow . At first I thought who writes these things ! How hard is that choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth , respectability and security as opposed to a husband who offers you only oppression , abuse , degradation and poverty . However our choices are not always as clear cut cut as one would think . Indeed the wealthy gentleman was all a woman could aspire to and yet ... the pull of her husband , her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming . What to do , what to do ? ? As a viewer you became as confused and misdirected as she was . Anyway what I really came on this site to gush about was my admiration of the voice of the Engish , I thought , although it is actually the voice of an Irish singer in the film . Looking him up I find he is Glen Hansard , whom I had never heard of before that day . What a find . I am so grateful . Wow , what a voice ! What a day ! Thank you BIFF ! , " positive
" This movie is true action at its finest , It doesn 't get any better then this . This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this . My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells " " I will come in here anytime i like ! ! ! " " and right before he jumps out the window he yells " " Anytime ! ! !

" I channel surfed past this many times , mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy , so " " Love American Style " . " However , it turned out to be quite good , very well done . The two stand-out features are the dialog and acting . Great cast . The premise is actually well executed and there aren 't too many weak moments . I guess what I was most amazed by was how often you thought the wheels are going to come off the cart , and instead , the cart just banks the turns , so to speak , and the movie keeps flying . There are some nice little sub-plots , particularly the relationship that develops between the character played by former Conan sidekick Andy Richter . Also , want to mention that the music accompanying it was good . , " positive
" This is a tepid docu-drama that covers no new ground , reworks all the cliches and is sloppy with facts . For example , Munich is a very flat city . So why is it hilly in the movie ? For example , the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice . Yet it is announced as a surrender . For example , European news vendors did not ( and do not ) shout headlines as they hawk their papers . Yet this strictly American custom is employed in the film . For example , the Nazis did not adopt the German eagle until after they had taken power but there it is on the lectern as Hitler delivers one of his stem winders . Indeed , most of this disappointing production consists of little more than Hitlerian oratory . The movie also perpetuates the myth that the beer hall putsch was hatched at the Munich Hoffbrauhaus . It was not . Robert Carlyle does a fine portrayal of his subject . But his supporting cast is adequate at best and very often not even that . These comments are based on the first episode only . One only can hope the second will be better but don 't bet on it . , " positive
I really enjoyed the performances of the main cast . Emma Lung is courageous and interesting . The director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional . A complex story with the changing between eras . Also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town . I do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive . There have be many relationships with older men and younger women - without the male being good looking . Depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow . The film has a good look and the cinematography is also good . , positive
OK with Coolio in it I should have known better ! But Noooooooo.Within 3 mins you 've encountered 5 bites from other movies & and TV shows ... 8 mins Casper Van Dien should have learnt by now ! 10 mins you 're feeling sorry for Tom ' Tiny ' Lister Jr. that he has been reduced to doing movies like this.15 mins Erika Eleniak Shows up looking like Zena.20 mins you 're ready to shoot you 're self ... How these movies receive funding is beyond me ! And yes I watched the whole thing . The Ending is priceless ! ! ! Just stay away ! , negative
" Beautiful attracts excellent idea , but ruined with a bad selection of the actors . The main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers . Apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring . First , it considers it illogical behavior . No one normal would not behave the way the main character behaves . It all represents a typical Halmark way to endear viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence . Does such a scenario , or the casting director and destroy this question is on Halmark producers . Cat is the main character is wonderful . The main character behaves according to his friend selfish . , " negative
" this show disturbs me. it takes up slots on nick at nite that could be reserved for the fresh prince or George Lopez. even full house and Roseanne. they 're all better than home improvement. first off , the mother Jill annoys me SO much. she is an oversensitive whiny baby and i really despise her. brad is a fat toad , and he is annoying too. and the youngest brother , i don 't even know his name ! i don 't notice him at all ! that 's probably not the actor 's fault though , it 's probably the writers ' . Tim is just a stupid ass. although Jill is DEFINITELY my least favorite , i don 't like any of them. the only reason i gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to randy. as the middle child , he is still a pesky little brother , but an older brother , and i like his fun character. the other star goes to Al. as the chubby friend , his character is likable. other than randy and Al , this show sucks . , " negative
" Deceptive Advertising ... I saw a commercial for Carlitos Way : Rise to Power that states " " From the Producer of Scarface and Carlito 's Way " " LETS GET IT STRAIGHT ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface , in fact he was ' editing room assistant ' for Scarface . Not to take away from Bergman 's talent ... but in my opinion he should of had a little more class . I think I can speak for the masses when I say ... We hate being blatantly lied to . As far as the movie goes , It was poor at best . I did think Puff Daddy did a good job . Although , Luis Guzman should be ashamed for working on this film . Overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for Carlito 's Way . It 's obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film . , " negative
" This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty ( and sometimes shrewish-seeming ) wife and crazy in-law ( s ) . With this show , it 's fat unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service . He has a pretty wife , Carrie ( Leah Remini ) , who works as legal assistant , and senile father-in-law , Arthur Spooner ( Jerry Stiller ) , who lives in his daughter and son-in-law 's basement . Kevin James ' Doug is your typical beer drinking , sports loving , TV watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues . He also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show 's couple . Beyond the few laughs supplied by Jerry Stiller 's crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny . Kevin James ' imbecilic behavior usually caused the show 's problems that usually resolved by his wife . This show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father / husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on ABC for some reason . , " negative
" When I first watched this show on Cartoon Network , I found it uninteresting . Then I read a lot of good messages about this show , and I decided to watch it . The show was so boring . Each episode was predictable . More , this show has no logic . Hypersmart girls , who are going to school and sometimes do such stupid things , 99 % of episodes start with a Monster attacking Townswille , then Mayor ( he is a real fool , he is NOT funny , he is so stupid , that I can 't imagine how he became a Mayor ) . Professor , yes , supposed to be the smartest person in this show , but actually ... He even found no difference between monster and his brother . Narrator 's comments also make this show boring . Because they also have similar lines in the beginning of each episode and in the ending . Also the animation is very strange . Everything except main heroes is shown in an ugly way . Also in every epsode this show is giving you some life-lessons , and it means that it is oriented on little children , but if you look closer , you will see , that there is a lot of violence and even blood ( ! ! ! ) during their battles . , " negative
" I thought this movie had absolutely no moral . I mean , how would you feel if your fiancì±• left you on your wedding day for your cousin ? ? ? I would be heartbroken ! ! It 's classified as a comedy but I didn 't find it funny at all . I thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them . I normally love Julie Stiles movies , but this is an exception . Jason Lee stars in another disgraceful show , which once again proves that class and decent morals are not relevant in todays society . It had a complete lack of taste and I despise movies like this . I understand that people will defend this movie and it 's morals because it is ' Just a movie ' , but I still stand by my mark that this bad behaviour shouldn 't be allowed on screen . I 'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie , you are a bad person , as everyone is entitled to their own opinion , and parts of this movie were enjoyable , I 'm just saying that in real life , people acting like the characters in this film were doing is shameful . , " negative
" Or that 's what the filmmakers would like you to believe , anyway.This movie tries sooo hard to be cool it 's ridiculous . Everything , from the look of the film , the cinematography , the editing , the dialogue and the acting , is geared in super cool mode from the get go . Just to make sure that no one misses how cool this film is , there 's a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a twangy western-surf-tex mex guitar playing constantly throughout the film . As a final reminder of how frickin cool this movie is , all the actors have been instructed to speak in a hoarse voice , because , as we all know , that 's badass.The plot ( if there indeed is one ) seems pretty straightforward . But as someone else already pointed out , the director and star of the film , seems fiercely determined not to tell that story , instead focusing on a plethora of naked babes and dialogue that 's supposed to be badass , but grows tired surprisingly quick ( did they have an contest to see how many times they could cram the words " " pussy " " and " " f * ck " " and its derivatives in an 80 minute film ? ) .This movie was absolutely horrible . , " negative
" This is an installment in the notorious Guinea Pig series . A short lived japanese TV-show , that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show . This short in the series is , like all the other films in the series , practically without any story . A group of guys have captured a young woman . They tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while videofilming her . They beat her , pour boiling oil over her , use pliers on her and finally , in " " loving " " closeup , push a needle through her eye . This is the most straightforward of all the Guinea Pig movies , and one of the first . It was probably this film , more than any of the others , that gave Guinea Pig the rumour of being snuff . They certainly gave inspiration to Nicolas Cage 's movie " " 8 mm . " . " These movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles . They have progressed to more polished , but equally graphic movies like " " Naked Blood " . " They probably fill the void left by the Mondo movies , that got slightly cleaned up and became reality TV . Not recommended , but will probably allure those who will see anything once , and wonder why afterwards , I know I did . , " negative
" I remember catching this movie on one of the Showtime channels . What stood out for me is that this movie takes place entirely in Phoenix , Arizona . I 'm from there so I spot the locales easily.Regardless , a ninja kills a scientist , because they wear yellow sweaters and golf , who is pursued by the police . It takes about half the police force to take him down and when they do eventually kill him , there are no discernible bullet wounds . His spirit lives on however when a woman finds her and touches his katana.From then on , she periodically gets possessed and kills the police officers who killed the original ninja . Then another ninja from Japan comes to kill the evil ninja . This might be a plot device from the previous two films , or perhaps a plot hole . All I know is that this movie is very campy , bad and entertaining . This is something to watch with a tub of popcorn , and several friends and give it the MST3K treatment . , " negative
" The reviewer from Poland must be a feminist , for she finds " " Young Catherine " " to be a great film and historically accurate . Nothing could be further from the truth . As a practicing Russian historian for many , many years I took exception with YC at almost every turn , and in particular the politically correct depiction of her as the boss who single-handed moved Russia into a direction of dominance . The truth ? She was only brought to St.Petersburg to be a wife and mother , and found she had to " " bond " " with the dvoriane , the boyars , and the military just to survive . So long as she did not challenge them she was able / permitted to indulge her cultural wishes ( filling up the Hermitage with art treasures , etc . ) . There are so many proofs that she was not " " great , " " but in this area of post-modern revisionism proof is not very popular . YC is only a costume drama , a bit of fluff from Ted Turner that , like " " Peter the Great " " in 1986 , is one more example of how badly Russia is portrayed in the West . , " negative
" This is one of the best movies I have ever seen ... It 's so full of details and every time you see it you 'll find new things ...

" For an independent film it scores well with reasonably high production values and a great cast . The acting is uneven but the plot is compelling . We could have used a bit more development of Wes Ramsey 's character , but hey , the guy 's fun to look at nonetheless ! Mary Kay Place and Jacqueline Bisset are like icing on the cake.It 's not surprising that it was controversial on its release . It presents a less than flattering portrayal of the Morman Church and its relationship with gays . While , like Brokeback Mountain , it 's about tolerance and accepting one 's own life , I found it to be more successful in conveying a positive message . It was more moving , too . , " positive
" Let me start out by saying I 'm a big Carrey fan . Although I 'll admit I haven 't seen all of his movies * cough * the magestic * cough * . Bruce Almighty was enjoyable . None of the other reviews have really gone into how cheesy it gets towards the end , I dont know what the writers were thinking . Somehow I couldn 't help but feel like this movie was a poor attempt at re-creating Liar Liar.On a positive note , The Daily Show 's Steve Correl is HILARIOUS and so is the rest of the cast . See Bruce Almighty if you 're a big Jim Carrey fan , or if you just want to see a light-hearted ( que soft piano music ) somewhat funny comedy . , " positive
" This is one of the first independent movies I 've ever seen . For such a very low budget , it was done well ; as an insomniac myself , I can sympathize with the main character , although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing . Well directed , well acted , of a subject that I haven 't seen much in theaters , lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting . There are few noticeable goofs , but they may be intended ; you 'll see after you watch the movie . The movie is very personal , and worth watching twice . No movie is flawless , but a Hollywood version couldn 't do the story better. all in all , 8 / 10 . , " positive
" Where do I start . Lets list the good things about this movie first.1. Mikael Persbrandt is great as the Gangster Thomas . This is the only character you will actually care about , and he 's a bad guy ! ( allthogh never does anything bad , and is generally a pretty likable guy ) 2 . Kjell Bergkvist is always great . He 's a bit toned down here , but he is quite funny still 3 . The movie looked pretty good by Swedish standards , good use of depth of field and lights.Now the bad . This is by far the worst script to make it into the big screen ever . The acting by everyone else was pretty bad and over the top . The direction was horrible . A totally meaningless story , totally unrealistic characters and events and 1.5 hours to long . During emotional scenes pretty much everyone in the theater laughed . People just started walking out during the course of the screening . There 's no way to actually summarize the story into something coherent , so I wont even try . Every clichì±• ever conceived is in there , and in all the wrong places . I 'm sorry to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life . Watch it for a good laugh , but try not to pay any money for it ; ) .R , " negative
" This is a pretty clever , well-acted version of the " " modern " " 30s woman 's fairytale romance . In this case , she helps the man she loves become head of the company while serving as his secretary and eventually wins his love from a scheming social butterfly . Interestingly , her business sense is shown as subtly parallel to her homemaking prowess , and the ladies of the office are depicted as the " " powers behind the throne . " " Lifted way above the average by Mrs. Astor 's intelligent performance . , " positive
" British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types : the quiet , introspective , usually romantic study and the farcical social satire . Settings , characters , and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories . Butterflies is perhaps the epitomì±• of the first type . The scripts are very verbal , including long interior monologues by the main character Ria , a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life . When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman ( who makes his interest in her quite clear ) , she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered.The acting and scripts are always on the money , which makes one 's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one : I was neither blown away by it nor turned off . My mother , on the other hand , adored this show . I think the degree to which one identifies with Ria 's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one 's reaction to Butterflies . , " positive
" Brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies . The voyeuristic element during the scenes ( Santa & Pedro summarize society 's behavior peering through a telescope ) is unique ( and obviously Jean-Luc Godard , although he was subtle , stole this theme in his film " " Pierrot le-fou " " ) . Highly recommended ! , " positive
" You like to solve mysteries ? You like complex narrations ? This is for you . Brilliant , clever movie by Francis Leclerc ( son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc ) . Flashy photo and clever editing is the word of Leclerc , strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who 's dythirambic in the lead role.The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur , veterinary in his 40 's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown . Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer 's sufferings on the road . Throughout the struggling , he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him.Not spooky , but very mysterious and well played movie . I have my hypothesis on the ending ( I think the Indian caused the accident ) but this ending was open to any explanations.I strongly recommend it 9.5 / 10 , " positive
" I wish I could give this movie a zero . Cheesy effects and acting . The only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is . Lets start with the kid who plays Brian . What a geek ! I couldn 't believe the mullet ! Then there was the talking to himself . I guess they couldn 't just have the movie be silent , but still . Of course they had to have him skinny-dipping too , not something I wanted to see . But Jared gave a great performance , compared to the special effects department . Everything from the bear to the crash was something I could do myself , and better . I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production , seeing as the movie was not even called Hatchet . Finally , I do not think the writer had ever read the book , seeing as nothing was the same . I think the book was great , but this movie stunk like a smelly goat ! , " negative
In Micro Phonies the stooges are at there best . In this short the trio are handymen working in a recording studio .

" I claim no matter how hard I seek I 'll never find a better movie version of " " Othello " . " If you love Kenneth Branagh 's magnificent masterpieces " " Much ado about nothing " " ( 1993 ) and " " Hamlet " " ( 1996 ) as much as I do I 'm dead certain you 'll also find Oliver Parker 's " " Othello " " irresistible . Laurence Fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career . He was quite terrific in " " Boys n the hood " " ( 1991 ) - I 've always considered his amusing role of Furious Styles as his very greatest achievement . That was , of course , way before I saw this.He plays the part of Othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant , fantastic job . Irì±”ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story 's crooked , manipulate villain Iago . Marvelous " " Othello " " is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeare 's ingenious works . It deals with his favorite topics : crookedness , envy , deceitfulness and jealousy . This movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films I 've seen that 's based on William Shakespeare 's plays . , " positive

You enjoy it while you watch it , and you take it home with you . I can 't say it is totally flawless , but it 's near . Acting - great , story -interesting and with elements of suspense . It 's a small family story , pretty much predictable , but it 's not the secret itself that matters. it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it . I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship ( the blind girl and her cousin ) . The only thing I didn 't like that much is the actress that played the mother , she was too tough and without necessity . Keren , " positive
" I saw this movie with my mother , and I loved it ! It was such a sweet story , ( Not to mention funny because of the supporting cast ! ) They never make movies like this ... ever ! My favorite part is when Grace ( Minnie Driver ) finds out about her boyfriend 's wife 's death , and that she has the deceased wife 's heart and she screams , " " WHAT WAS GOD THINKING ? " " I do believe everyone ( No matter who you believe in ) has thoughts like that once in awhile . But while it 's very sappy , it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for all . ( Sigh ) The comedic timing between Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi will just make you crack up ( especially in the aforementioned scene , it 's terrible , and yet so funny ! ) . They make a good pair , and I hope to see them again in something soon . 10 / 10 Stars , " positive
" I 've always been a great fan of Woody Allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past , but only a blind lover could ignore how dull , meaningless , pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is . A vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds . And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed " " actor Allen-clone " , " that is putting into Will Farrell 's mouth and gestures what Allen would have done in Farrell 's place had he been 30 years younger . The outcome was obviously ludicrous . And not to speak of the dialogues ... what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering , unaware of its comic effect . How sad ... , " negative
" The idea 's which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and depict what a lot of people from around the world think of the American Policies , not neccessarily the United States itself .

" This movie is basically a spoof on Hitchcock 's Strangers on a train , which i thought was overrated anyway . The plot has Danny Devito going to see Strangers and then thinking Billy Crystal wants them to swap murders , For Crystal to murder his mother and Devito to murder his wife .

" The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work . In fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.At least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning . Black gore is hardly frightening , nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp Lugosi style.The narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine ' Naked Lunch ' directed by Russ Meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque . Otherwise give this film a wide girth . Bava and Argento fans - once again - are bitterly disappointed . , " negative

This isn 't far away from the trash that Bollywood normally makes but there 's just something really good about it.The title song is one of Bollywoods best and is haunting throughout . This is one of the films ( along with Baazigar - a must see Bollywood film ) that made Shah Rukh Khan and it 's for this you have to check it out.Other reviews give away the story - it is a fairly basic idea - ShaRukh definitely stands out and one of his final expressions right at the end made me give this film an extra star.Its fairly cheesy but definitely worth watching if you are new to Bollywood or not ! 8 / 10 , positive

As a storm rages outside , Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger ... the killer is still on the premises !

Malmar 's tale was first brought to television in 1962 as an episode of Boris Karloff 's THRILLER anthology series . THRILLER stuck very closely to the story , which is kind of a pity , for it could have used a little punching up .

" A young ( only 21 ) director with great talent , a powerful scenario , young and ambitious cast with all theatrical background ... One of the first tries of a thriller in Turkish cinema , which seems in the future we 'll have some more based on the success ... Shot on high definition video , the movie is perhaps effected on world thrillers , especially the American thrillers . The technical and cinematographic character is quite well done , the scenes are all well worked on . Not too much blood but sufficient enough to make you think you 're in a blood bath too ... The scenario is quite wise but with certain clues , a clever audience can easily predict what 's going on and at the end when everything settles down you 're getting somehow weird to conclude the result.Well done Tiglon , one of the biggest DVD distributors in Turkey , it is not easy to decide for such a movie in their first try as a production company ... , " positive
" This movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop . Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie " " Sholay " , " but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and ... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie ( acting , script , songs , music , comedy , action etc ) out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew . Waste of money , waste of time . After making movies like Rangeela , Satya , and Company he pulled a Coppola ( Godfather ) on us ; What were you thinking RGV ? Anyways , the story is , though hard to follow , is almost like the Old sholay . Ajay Devgan playing Heero ( Beeru , sholay ) and Ajay , new kid on the block playing Ajay ( Jay , sholay ) .

Later in the movie , now Retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan .

" This movie came out about the same time as Pretty Woman . While the general theme is the same : wealthy man meets and learns to love a poor working class woman , the characters of Romuald and Juliette are much more lovable and worthy of our time with them . I have never forgotten them and consider the movie superior to Pretty woman in so many ways . Juliette is a remarkable woman and the clever ways she helps her boss overcome his problems will make you cheer . The final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy . The efforts Romuald makes to win the love of Juliette surpass the puny climbing scene of Pretty Woman a hundred times over . See this movie , it will warm your heart . , " positive
" This film has been lauded to the point of the ridiculous . " " American Movie " " is a boring documentary about a boring person so ordinary you 'll find equivalents on just about every corner in America . It takes a long , hard look at a guy who 's failed at just about everything in the interest of making an independent movie .. or two . Were his failures for other than his own selfish pursuits or were they in the name of real art , the movie might have had a chance . America has an abundance of better stories to be told . This one should be flushed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed . Two thumbs up indeed ! , " negative
" what a lousy movie , took me 3 times to finish it . The thing i disliked the most was the infantile sense of humor. jokes made by a 10 years old child. not funny. pretty annoying actually , for example when the detective cant get a place at the bar he yells " " she 's taking it all off " " and then they all run " " fast foreward " " slapstick kinda ' rush. so stupid. and also a guy sitting at the bar smashing fruit to work out his post traumatic stress disorder. on the bar ! and the bartender is supplying him with more and more fresh fruit. thats supposed to be funny ? and i mean ... i love good ol ' exploitation gore flicks , and saw a lot of terrible movies , but his one is plain bad. and also the " " gore " " is not that exciting. don 't bother. i wouldn 't recommend it . , " negative
" I liked the first movie , but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better of left on the drawing board . The general idea in the first movie was , if not great , then at least very interesting . This sequel tries to build upon the idea and the characters from the first movie , and though Christopher Walken is still good as Gabriel , the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous . If you haven 't seen any of these movies , then get the first movie and forget about the sequels , they can take away all of the joy from the original . , " negative
" Slow , Slow , Slow ... There is no mystery or excitement in this film . If you don 't figure out who the " " mole " " is in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead . The secret service must have been too , because it took them the whole film to put it together . There are no compelling characters in the movie ( not film ) . The pace of the movie is slow there is no tension . The hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming at Michael Douglas than all he seems to be able to hit is large panes of glass . The funniest scene in the movie is when the presidents wife says the code word at the anticlimactic ending . It is laugh out loud ridiculous . At least six people got up and left the movie early . I would have joined them if I were not sitting in the middle of the row . I would not recommend this film to anyone . , " negative
" I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I 've every seen ( though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment ... * sigh * ) . It was nice to see Cox outside of the incessantly brittle " " Coxism State " " he is in these days , if only for brief moments . I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character 's hair ( or height , in case of JD ) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes . I can also see how Zach might be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase / or is that Matthew Perry ? prat-fall induced chemical slide ( already acknowledged on Conan ) . A little side note , the song ( now stuck in my head ) from the janitor-induced dance montage was " " Diner " " by Martin Sexton . , " negative
" I watched the whole movie , waiting and waiting for something to actually happen . Maybe it 's my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology ? Is it a weird re-telling of the Oedipal myth : I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him ? I didn 't understand why certain plot elements were even present : why was the construction upstairs , why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so , why have the scenes at all with the father at work , why have such a nice kitchen if you 're only going to eat takeout , why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around . I see lots of good reviews for this movie ... has my taste been corrupted by going up with 70s b-movies and old sci fi flicks ? , " negative
An excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone . I liked this movie because Glenn Corbett also appeared in Star Trek as Zeffrem Cochrane in 1967 . I also liked it because I am a fan of the apollo space program . , positive
" Renown writer Mark Redfield ( as Edgar Allen Poe ) tries to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself , as a Baltimore , Maryland magazine publisher . However , blackouts , delirium , and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts . He would also like to rekindle romance with an old sweetheart , a significantly flawed prospect , as things turns out . Mr. Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe . Redfield employs a lot of black and white , color , and trick photography to create mood . Kevin G. Shinnick ( as Dr. John Moran ) performs well , relatively speaking . It 's not enough . , " negative
" I couldn 't stand to watch very much of this crap . This is your standard junk that certain annoying women love- old English era drama with lots of costumes and clichì±• characters that seem to be plucked from either directly from oliver twist or some other dickens novel . This uses the usual clichì±•s from the Victorian era . Certain idiotic people really think that the whole emotional torture of that culture being so bloody repressed is somehow fascinating and romantic . This is sap , pure and utter junk and boring as watching grass grow . As such it is perfect for women who crave some sort of English countryside snoozer romantic drama in a Victorian setting but for this man this movie is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment to watch a bunch of drab boring scenes with unoriginal characters speaking in that wretched forced and fake English accent . , " negative
" Contains Spoiler The movie is a good action / comedy but i don 't know if the director cut too many parts but it seems that the bad guy die too fast . The end of the movie come , the bad guy dies and that 's it.The special effects are good and i don 't regret paying to see it at the theatre . , " positive
" there was some truth to this movie . I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished . I also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse ( or some such charge ) . I 'm not sure if it was in Australia . The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders . Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception . The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan . But as far a being one of the best Australian films ever , as someone claimed , I can 't be that generous . Put it this way , I wouldn 't bother watching it again . , " negative
" I absolutely hate this programme , what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ? ? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I 'm well out of the room before it comes on . Its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless . What happened to detective programmes with real mystery ? ? ? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago ? ? ? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this . , " negative
" it 's hard to tell the actors from the non-actors . Bad American movies can be spotted by all the youngsters prefacing every single line of dialog with " " You know what ? " " Bad Canadian movies can be spotted by all the youngsters ending every single line of dialog with " " Eh ? " " Have we learned nothing in a century of filmmaking ? Cannot the entire weight of millions of wannabes descending on Hollywood with scripts and reels in hand rescue us from these horrible TV-movies-made-to-order ? , " negative
" I went to see it 2 times this movie , a friend of mine went to see it at the release party , and he was telling me it was so great , that I was expecting very much about the movie , to mutch , I couldn 't enjoy it because I was not watching it in nuteral position . The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time . After The second time I felt so in the mood to have a party . I LOVED the music it 's just great.If Tom Barman improves his directing talent he will be a director where everyone will be talking about . If you can delivere this movie as your first you must be talented.The acting is done by some great belgian stars ( Dirk roofthooft ) and a bunch of upcomming talents like Titus De Voogdt . , " positive
" I usually have a difficult time watching a TV movie , the extra long commercial breaks will break my concentration and I give up and find a good book . This one however made me put up with the adds and stay with it to the end . I realize the movie was based on a true story but it was not brought out why it took so long to find Denny ? They had his name and I would presume his social security number . While he did move around a lot it would seem he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job etc . The actors seemed a bit old for the part and a buried metal object when dug up had no rust . These were only technical glitches and did not take from the file . For a LifeTime Movie it was better than most . , " positive
" I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece . I 'd recommend to buy this movie on DVD because it 's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once . And trust me , you 'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times.The characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced , no black and white . Even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists , there is also empathy for the other characters.I think the IMDb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content . , " positive
" How to round up every possible clichì±• and stereotype existing in the genre of horror and then subsequently stuff them into one massively lousy movie ? The answer : " " Camp Blood " . " This is amateurish slasher nonsense made on a micro-budget and a little bit too obvious inspired by " " Friday the 13th " . " Four of the most intolerable teenage characters you 'll ever see í˜¯ they 're like a combination of ugly , stupid and annoying í˜¯ go camping and quickly find themselves pursued by a homicidal maniac in a clown suit . Don 't even ask me what the killer 's motivations were or even who he / she was , because if it did feature in the film , I totally missed it . This is one of the worst movies ever made , with no inspiration or craftsmanship whatsoever . The production values were so pitiable that there are actors playing multiple roles without even bothering to make them unrecognizable . The only half-decent and worthwhile sequence throughout the whole of " " Camp Blood " " is the opening in which the impressively voluptuous Meredith O 'Brien has sex in the woods with her geeky boy scout . Yes , I 'm fully aware that this is a totally shallow remark to make , but then again this is a juvenile and retarded film , so who cares ? , " negative
" " " Masks " " is a moving film that works on many levels . At its simplest , it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art ( masks ) to the next generation . Although , at times the story makes the old man into a Job , it is so well crafted ( written , acted , directed , wonderful production values ) , it is easy to move beyond his plight . And , if you hang with it , the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting . Kudos all around . This is a wonderful film for children as well as adults . The trick is how to get Americans who may not like foreign language films to see it ! , " positive
" I love B movies , but I like to be aware from the beginning that I 'm watching one . I can 't believe someone could mess up a movie about aliens and predators so bad . Aliens and Predator are AWESOME . This movie made a big joke out of them . The creators didn 't take this movie seriously at all . I am throughly disappointed in how the Strauss jerks handled this film . They made a mockery of amazing characters . It 's like they were trying to be serious in the beginning , then their writers got high and gave up . Almost nothing was continuous , the main characters were awful and were NOT Aliens or Predators . I am so ridiculously sad that no one takes Alien and Predators seriously anymore . These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this movie showed no respect to the original films . They should not be allowed to cash in on the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves , " negative
" I picked up this video after reading the text on the box , the story seemed good , and it had Keanu Reeves ! But after 5 minutes of watching , I noticed how horrible his acting was , he walks and talks so stupid the whole time , it 's fake and not convincing . It doesn 't end there , almost ALL the characters act so badly it 's laughable , the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce ( David ) , but the guy commits suicide early on and you don 't see him again , you never even know why he did it ! Everything about this movie screams low quality , I can 't believe how such a thing gets released ! I was tempted many times to stop watching , in fact I did , half way through it I decided to stop watching and turned the thing off , came to the IMDB to check what other 's thought about it , I found zero comments ( not surprised ) , so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it . The only good thing going ( for me ) was the high-school Rock band theme , the occasional guitar playing and singing parts , but that 's not worth it.Very bad acting and directing ... Terrible movie . , " negative
" * May be spoilers * No doubt one of the best dramas if not the best in the genre I 've ever seen . Is Prot an alien or just a crazy bugger ? This is the question you 'll be asking yourself all throughout the movie . Kevin Spacey is simply amazing , as is Jeff Bridges . You can 't beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times . Some of Kevin Spaceys actions in this movie are very funny . When he was up in the tree , for example , and when he was talking to the " " queen " " mental patient , the way he hid half his face around the wall and just stared.To simply put it , right from the start you 'll be hooked , and if you really love drama 's you won 't be dissapointed.A solid 85 % . , " positive
" One of the worst movies I 've seen shoddy camera work , crappy filter usage , film was grainy , script was terrible , i mean come on , how predictable was the big battle at the end ..... some of the fight scenes were okay i guess .... some scenes were so bad it was comical ... like Sorbo getting the horse and riding at the end ... LOL i mean really .. a horse ? Oh cant forget how the bad assassins roll around in the same vehicle throughout the entire movie .. one would think that after killling key witness and federal agents , they woulda been tracked down .. ETC , ETC really don 't bother watching it ... , " negative
" In a time when Hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses , despair , crime , drugs , and war , along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the " " Indomitable Spirit " . " If you are feeling beaten down , this movie will free your mind and set you soaring . We all know how tough life can be , sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through . That 's what this film did for me and I hope it will for you . , " positive
" I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this , God that and Christ is our saviour stuff . The movie and the story line did not need it . If , as I am , you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous . The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been . , " negative
" when I know that Walter will never grace another set.I was in my 30 's when I first saw this sweet , endearing and unabashedly romantic film.I loved it from the first scene , and all the way through to the end.Art Carney was his usual daft self ; Glenda matched Walter step for step in the witticisms ; and Richard Benjamin supplied the sarcastic voice of reason that he does so well.Along the way there were many actors whom we all recognize , doing their usual brilliance . There are a couple of lines in the movie which my SO and I have used throughout the years , but I won 't say anything about them here.I 'm pretty sure you will know which two I am talking about . Just get this movie.Make some popcorn , grab your squeeze ( if he is as sappy as mine is , for which I am thankful ) , and enjoy this standout romantic comedy from the 70 's . You will not be disappointed . However , I have the feeling that I am preaching to the choir here because anyone who loves Walter will already own it.I 'm very glad it 's out on DVD now , finally . , " positive
" A better film could have been made to portray the tragedy of Bosnia . Some parts are very effective and the film does well to give some idea of the suffering of the people specially the children , but overall it looks less like a film and more like a documentary . Woody Harrelson is very good but the rest of the cast has performed well without being extra ordinary . Should be watched in order to get a rough idea of what the war did to the children of Bosnia . If one expects a great and gripping movie , Welcome ...... will be a disappointment . , " negative
" I went to see this film last night at the National Film Theatre in London , as a birthday treat . It was the the first time I 've seen it , and I think it has now overtaken the dreadful " " Twister " " as the worst film I have ever seen . Disjointed for no reason , self indulgent and full of imagery that oscillates from the crass and obvious to the obscure and unintelligible , not particularly beautifully or grimily shot , I really don 't understand why this is considered classic , gay or otherwise . I normally enjoy films that push boundaries or even films that are hard to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography . But this was truly , truly awful . , " negative
" I want to add to the praise for the production of this film , especially the luminous cinematography . Firelight glistening off of smooth and muscled skin creates stunningly beautiful imagery . The film was nominated for ( and won ) a single Oscar - the first given for editing . Mala 's performance is moody , penetrating and powerful . , " positive
" This is an excellent movie . Phoolan had no role model 's to base her actions on , yet was able to bring about very necessary change to a land that was living in darkness when it comes to female treatment . I like the fact that it was a real story rather than made up , it added to the horror of the story , & the triumph . , " positive
" If John Waters had written and directed " " House of 1000 Corpses " " after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object , the result would probably be something like " " The Blood Shed . " " It 's mildly entertaining for the first half hour , but then it slides into a sort of featureless glop of constant screaming and people doing things to each others genitalia with electric carving knives , cutlery and pliers . Susan Adriensen ( Sno Cakes ) is incredibly annoying and Terry West ( Elvis Bullion ) is almost as bad in whatever it is he 's doing in front of the camera.Maybe the best thing about " " The Blood Shed " " is that it won 't take most viewers very long to forget about it . , " negative
" I would of enjoyed this film but Van Damme just does the same old same old rubbish time after time . Poo knickers fight scenes as per usually . The only thing this loser left out was the Russians normally end up being killed in the end . This film is utter doggy do do of the highest nature , please please please Van Damme get some acting lessons , you need them . Anyone who likes Van Damme has issues , It seems sad that the only way Van Damme ever gets any acting work is when he co writes the film , co produces the film and does the screen play for the film . AVOID VAN DAMME AND HIS SLICKED BACK NASTY WIG . I give this film a two out of ten , because the one with the the sandman was better . To add insult to injury I wasted a quid on this manure , " negative
" I thought this was a great idea but , boy , was it poorly executed . We do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of a show are , but virtually no specifics about any of it works . The producers don 't seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a " " through-line . " " ( Which is not to say they didn 't try , but having the stagehands relate a synopsis of the Ring cycle as the program 's narrative does nothing to tell us about the job of physically mounting an opera . ) We see lots of things happening , but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why . There 's little sense of who is who , or how the various production departments fit and work together . For instance , several times we hear about a problem of some sort -- one expects then to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it gets resolved . But instead the filmmakers generally just cut to something else ( generally , pretty generic footage of people pushing stuff or talking into headsets . ) Overall the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of images that you 'd see run under the closing credits of a show , rather than anything worth watching for its own merit . , " negative
" This movie is just boring.It tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like Jeunet in " " Amì±•lie Poulain " , " but it is too much . The dialogs are pretty bad , some of the worst I have ever heard , Guillaume Canet is not convincing ( I have almost never found him very convincing ) , his father in the movie plays very badly , the story is dumb , the ending is ... stupid.I think I have not dislike a movie so much since " " le pacte des loups " " ( brotherhood of the wolf ) from Christophe Gans ( and I watch / see about 80-100 movies a year ) , but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors.I had never commented here ( only rated ) , and when I saw the rating and the comments , I thought I had to write something down.I guess we won 't have problems to sell the DVD we were offered : not such a bad movie in our ( large ) collection ! ! ! I am open minded ( I watch SF , westerns , drama , comedies , silents , horror , fantasy ... movies ! ) , but this movie was so boring that I felt like I had lost one hour and a half . , " negative
" The movie never becomes intolerable to watch . And to tell it straight , it has nothing to show either , except maybe part-sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy non-sexy character in revealing quite-sexy dresses . The story is very easy to follow or there 's nothing to follow -- you can see in either way . There is no suspense , little action , unimpressive dialogs , unsatisfactory sensuality , same boring locations and very bland acting . Kevin Dillon is totally worthless . Silverstone ... well , I didn 't concentrate too much on her acting , I confess . Yet as I said earlier , if one has nothing to do except watching a movie , this won 't look so bad . 4 / 10 , " negative
" Just saw this film the other day at the Santa Fe Film Festival . I was delighted by its honesty and humor . It was the most thought provoking movie I 've seen in a very long time -- I just can 't get it off of my mind for some reason . It may not be for everyone , because it makes you think . I don 't know if people like to think in movies so much anymore , which is a shame . The actors who play the Franklins are quite a find . I couldn 't imagine playing these complicated people with such frankness . Though I thought a couple of the supporting characters were not as good as the Franklins , I can totally forgive it -- because this is an important movie in my opinion . I didn 't expect to like it so much , but as I 've thought about it for a few days , it 's proving to be a very relevant piece of entertainment . , " positive
" For a movie shot in 18 days and a budget less than 2 million , this little movie that could deserves a ' best we could ' award .

" The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie ? Even the soundtrack will do . If that 's not possible , can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers ? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there . I tried CD baby , not there either . I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren 't any . I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question . I know that the songs belong to Country Music and is sung by a country artist . I just need the title names along with the singer . I would recommend this movie or rather the songs to any country loving person . , " positive
" The performances of Fishbourne ( who appears strangely funny somehow ) and ( short featured ) Ed Harris are remarkable , unlike Connery 's who doesn 't appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man . In fact the screenplay doesn 't make sense ; imagine a 60 min. happy ending-plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters . It 's more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen-wrights ' schools . The more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets . The capital punishment is not an issue here , although it is a subject from the beginning ; it sort of fades away without further comment . The subject-matter and environment could have been good . , " negative
" this is just a terrible ' comedy ' -- it really is a bad film. there are no funny elements. no jokes that are funny. i don 't know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be ' smartest ' or ' quality .

" German-born Turkish director Faith Akin captures in his film the endless variety of the different styles in music and songs in Istanbul , a city that is a bridge between East and West , a city that is uniquely located on both sides of the Bosporus , in Europe and in Asia . Kurdish dirges represented by Aynur , who performs her own brand of Kurdish gospel music , passionate and melodic . We are introduced to Romany instrumentals , to Orhan Gencebay , who has been called the Elvis of Arabesque music - sounds of music are heard everywhere in the city as Faith Akin takes us into underground clubs , to the street performers , and to recording sessions . German bassist Alexander Hacke who comes to Istanbul to play and to learn about Turkish music quotes Confucius , " " To understand the place , you have to listen to the music it plays " . " Akin 's fine documentary does just that - gives us 90 minutes of music that helps to cross the bridges . For me , watching the movie was especially interesting because I recently visited Istanbul as a part of my vacation and spent four days there . The city fascinated me by its images , colors , crowds , vibrancy and visual beauty . Now , I can add the sounds of music to the ever-changing portrait of Istanbul . , " positive
" The quintessential road movie ... if your idea of a road movie involves three would-be magicians with Eastern European accents and Claire Forlani . ( Well , one out of four ain 't bad ... ) A no-talent magician with an eye for showmanship ( Max ) watches a very skilled pickpocket ( Hugo ) plying his trade in New York . After convincing Hugo that he ( Max ) is a ) mental and b ) desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive , the not-so-dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions ( Milo ) and the , ah , gentler attributes of a lovely waitress ( Lydia ) . The unlikely four pile into a van ( obtained by Hugo ... you guess where it came from ) and head to Vegas . Havoc ensues . Anyhow , it 's funny , it 's well-written , and the ending is surprisingly good . A solid comedy with a warm heart , and all the better that it was totally unexpected . , " positive
" COC had its moments . I enjoyed the action sequences , but I despised the screenplay and plot . I hate this film so much , I 'll just write about the dumbest part . First of all , the plot would never happen . Second , the bleakness of the Chinese President was uncalled for . That would never happen . Finally , the dialogue . Employing non-Chinese actors to play Chinese roles is understandable , but to write dialogue for them that 's TOTALLY OFF is dumb ! For those of you who understood the Chinese in the film , you know what I mean . , " negative
" A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production . Features performances from no-name actors that rival the top talent on the planet ( sadly none have persued a career ) . Also features the the god-like ability of Christopher Nolan to write perfect dialogue . Dialogue is what carries this story , which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books . Well shot , VERY well edited , even better written , and amazingly well performed.This movie has everything a great film needs , except people who have seen it . 9 / 10 , " positive
" This movie is a desperate attempt to ride the skirtales of the success of the Star Wars movies . The film uses recycled footage from " " Battle Beyond the Sars " " which is another Roger Corman Sci-Fi Turd , but atleast this one is better than " " Battle Beyond the Stars " " - there is no real acting in this film ( but its a Roger Corman film-What did you expect ) again the entire soundtrack was done on a Keyboard / Synthasizer , the sound effects are recycled from " " Battlestar Galactica " " - there are no special effects because they were recycled / rearranged space scenes from another movie , the costumes look like something right out of 1981 salvation army salvage . --ironicaly , the little boy in this film gives one helluva performance , and he 'd resurface again to star in the Sylvester Stallone movie " " Over the Top " " - I give this movie 3 stars out of 10 , " negative
" Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957.Well , the movie mainly takes place in 1986 . The movie falls into the 80 's trap of weird / stupid special effects , including some weird demented looking rocking horse.Anyway , Mary Lou 's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person 's body . Whether or not she succeeds , you 'll have to watch to find out.Anyway , the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters . This also isn 't really a sequel , the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school . It has the avg. horror flick fall backs , gore , pointless nudity , knocks against the catholic church . Basic stuff , boring movie.The acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10 . You can waste your time doing something else . , " negative
" This film was nothing more than exploitative gay cheesecake . It was not an " " art " " movie ; just an excuse to show several gratuitous , exploitative , over-the-top scenes with extensive male genital nudity . There was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men . The camera zooms in on the men 's asses and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their dicks in full screen view . There are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis . It gets redundant REAL fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously . I was wondering if I was watching a Playgirl video by mistake . If these same scenes were filmed using women ( ex : totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly ) it would be quickly dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy ... which is all that this film is . Any artistic merit got flushed down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality . The themes of class distinction , homosexuality , longing-desire , etc. were simple and superficial ; no more developed than what one would expect from a first year philosophy student . Just cut to the chase and rent a gay porn instead . , " negative
" This show is a great history story . It 's has everything from slavery , the way they were treated , religion , the ways Jews were sent into hiding , the inquisition , the belief in the Orisha the African gods , the way women were treated , including the daughters . Even down to homosexuality . The way the characters are intertwined and that Violante , that character saddens me . She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her.I am so glad they decided to re-release it to t.v. again . Although I would love to see the unedited version . Xica has become my Heroine . I look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it . I love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century . I look forward to my Xica every night . It would be great to dub it in English so the Americans can love her too . , " positive
" Not finding the right words is everybody 's problem in this vaudeville-type urban comedy . They don 't know what to say , and they don 't know how to say it , which is why they embark on the potentially humiliating enterprise of pre-arranged speed dating . Unfortunately , they all come across as cardboard characters rather than real people . The story follows a conventional three-act structure : getting to know the sizable cast in their sorry single lives , the actual dating circuit , and a final stretch of romantic fallout , showcasing some of the new-found couples ' follies . Because it 's all so predictable , I 'd say that as a narrative , " " Shoppen " " is a failure . As a comedy , most of the time it 's too goofy to be really funny . Thumbs up to Kathrin von Steinburg . She stands out from the soap opera crowd as the aloof , independently wealthy Miriam . Great makeup on her too ( Verena Weiíš©ert ) : Heavy eye shadow meets skin-tone lip gloss , creating a brooding and bohemian , yet girlish effect . Thumbs up also to Stefan Zinner as the Bavarian love machine and Tanja Schleiff as the hot nutritionist . They bypass the communication challenge by way of the timeless body language of copulation . , " negative
" This movie is great . Best acting i have ever seen in my life . Ingvar E Sigurì±¨sson is the best Icelandic actor , and of course Hilmir Snì±ˆr and Bjorn jì² rundur . Great music and sound . Cold hard reality about a struggle of a man that has a lot of problems and the people in his life . Black humor mixed with great acting and this European art movies style , it works , it comes together in a the best Icelandic movie ever made . I say to you . " " See this film , you will not regret it " . " I gave it 9 stars . If you see one Icelandic film in your life ... See this one , " positive
" This will be brief . Let me first state that I 'm agnostic and not exactly crazy about xtians , especially xtian fanatics . However , this documentary had a tone of the like of some teenager angry at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games . I just couldn 't take it seriously . Mentioning how CharlesManson thought he was Christ to illustrate the point that xtianity can breed evil ? i don 't know it was just cheap and childish -- made the opposition look ignorant . Furthermore , the narrator just seemed snobby and pretentious . The delivery was complete overkill . I can 't take this documentary seriously . Might appeal to an angry teenager piss3d off at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games . , " negative
" On the whole one wishes this was a better film , but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth while . Peck made this film during the same period that he made The Gunfighter , before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor . A pity ! He was a fine actor , perfectly willing to tackle characters that were not very likable , and to do them extremely well . The character he plays here is driven and , when necessary , ruthless . Given the mission the character has been assigned , and the " " men " " with which to do it , those characteristics are essential.Without being a spoiler , think of this film as an early , grittier example of The Dirty Dozen genre . The dialog in this film is a bit ham handed but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling . It contains good work by all the character actors and even Barbara Payton turns in a credible performance.This one isn 't often shown on television so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy . Go ahead ! Devote an evening to it . It is worth your time ! , " positive
" Another ' good overcoming evil ' story , but with a difference . This includes learning self-discipline . When Julie goes with her teacher to a Zen monastery , she learns about herself . She also hones her karate skills.When the Zen monks visit the city , some awkward and comical moments ensue . Not uproarious , but entertaining nonetheless.Next Karate Kid has much to say about looking within , and improving what is there -- as well as using what you have . , " positive
" Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky , a likable ex-convict just released from prison who helps the feds nab a corrupt small town sheriff . Laid-back Reynolds was often accused by critics of merely phoning these ' good ol ' boy ' performances in ; true , he 's on auto-pilot throughout . But in his day , Reynolds knew just how to make a low-key effort work well for himself . Ingratiating and handsome , Reynolds comes as close to winking at the audience as he can without breaking up ; he seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star , while director Joesph Sargent provides an easy pace and a sweaty ambiance which brings the South alive . Unfortunately , the story isn 't much , and supporting actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins overact ( as usual ) . Diane Ladd is fine in a small part , and real-life daughter Laura Dern can be glimpsed in the background . Reynolds returned to this character for 1976 's " " Gator " .

" Who ever put that review as ' of bad taste ' is not all quite there ... its so funny , genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square ! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series ... all is as good as Morris ' standards. if you think that it is ' awful ' , ' distasteful ' or ' sick ' then i can only think of one thing to say to you : " " go to hell . " " thanks. it had to be said ! i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete joke ... i would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that : " " haven 't you got anything better to do with your time ? what are you trying to prove ? " " thanks for reading my heart-filled review on the matter ... cheers , " positive
" Neat premise . Very unrealistic . What I learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all . I loved how Bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all ! Unfortunately , the same can 't be said for his gal . Oh , and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wreck.Lots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper ( still have nightmares from that scene ) . Poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand . I admit I was intrigued to see what the mysterious " " thing " " was behind the door , but when it appeared , I just laughed . HA HA HA ! ! The girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived . Personally , I really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that ! , " negative
" It was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience , to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most . However , this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan ( who became annoying as hell in her own right ) . Her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles . This film might have been more , as there was suitable budget for settings , actors and a decent story line . My wife and I both agreed that this was ' Muck ' at the end , as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high ! Better luck next time , hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like From Hell . , " negative
" I can admit that the screenplay isn 't very good , and that it has some slow parts , but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun . First of all , the performances are great ( Michael Douglas , Kim Basinger , Kiefer Sutherland , and Eva Longoria . Michael Douglas proves he has still got it , and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife . Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria , play the dynamic duo , both adding their incredible talent to the pot . And second of all , this movie is the most fun I have had in years in a Theodore . Its plain and simple , if you want to go to the movies , and have a lot of fun see , The Sentinel . , " positive
" Virgin is selected to marry rich guy . Rich guy urinates . Woman on boat likes sailor . Sailor urinates . Virgin attends gross-out commune dinner . Man urinates on dinner table . Boatwoman does strip tease for little boys . Man pretending to be baby urinates . There is an underlying theme here . Makavejev is trying to say that he is pi $ $ ed off at the world . To say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement . To justify the title , there is a scene where Laure , who hardly speaks ten lines the whole movie , bathes in chocolate syrup . It is a sweet scene indeed but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in one 's mouth unless one happens to share the director 's fetishes . , " negative
" This is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective . While the story is simple it is pure and straightforward . In truth , it is the standard story of a simple , honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period.Poor vs. Rich , honorable vs. dishonorable , a classic but well-told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen.Extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen . : ) , " positive
" I actually enjoyed Tycus , if not for much more than mocking the production values . Dennis Hopper was just fine , although I wonder if he would have signed on the project had he seen the special effects they used . And furthermore , what was with the scene with the ninja ? ? That was just completely out of pace . Perhaps someone came up with the bright idea mid-shooting . Oh well , This movie is great if you 're drunk and need a good laugh . Cheers . , " negative
" I 'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice . The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention . The script is sub-standard ( it 's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it ) . The direction is worse . Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn ( more prevalent obviously in the " " uncut " " version ) . The cinematography is especially sub par , giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs . The movie should 've looked a whole lot better . The overall concept of placing name actors in what would 've easily been an X-rated movie ( Guccione called it " " paganography " " ) wears thin after the first hour after Peter O 'Toole and John Guilgud exit . Bob Guccione obviously lavished a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste . If you want a far better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st Century watch the mid-79 's BBC production of I , CLAUDIUS instead ... and if you want porn , jeeze-Louise , look somewhere else . , " negative
" I thought this film was just about perfect . The descriptions / summaries you 'll read about this movie don 't do it justice . The plot just does not sound very interesting , BUT IT IS . Just rent it and you will not be sorry ! ! , " positive
For a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and Trey Parker and Matt Stone 's comic timing is perfect . There are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie . I especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes . Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries spoof is also very amusing . , positive
" This is the first 10 out of 10 that I 've given any movie . What made this movie so good for me ? Constant action - there isn 't any slow parts , great acting , smart writing . I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene . Finally , I get to see an action movie that doesn 't try to please all sectors of the public ( i.e. there 's no forced romance ) .I liked the first two Bourne movies , but I loved this one.Warning - after watching this movie , you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car ! , " positive
" I sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie . I 'm still not sure if I regret it or not . I felt like I was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didn 't quite make the cut . It plays up every Hollywood clichì±• imaginable , all the while flogging us with the ' corporations are the ultimate evil ' message . Subtlety this movie does not know . As far as that goes , it even manages to provide it 's own spoilers.The story appears to be a computer nerd 's fantasy world come true . The lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend , yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker ( I think ) , among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you 'll have to see for yourself.As well , I should 've known it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he tends to be a good tip-off.Can 't recommend this one , I 'm afraid . , " negative
" Sheba Baby is always underrated most likely because it has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating that a Grier movie gets. all that the pg means is that Pam doesn 't take her top off , she takes her top off in every other movie she 's been in though so. it is more exciting than Coffy , more action. it takes off slow but by the time she 's on screen the thrills have started. like Dolemite d 'urville martin is the heavy trying to get Sheba 's father , but she ain 't having that. she wages a one woman war against martin and his gang of cronies. the best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car which i 'm still laughing about. i thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating but i was wrong it replaces sex with violence and in a blaxplotation film that can only be good ! , " positive
" I don 't think any movie of Van Damme 's will ever beat Universal Soldier but u never know . This movie was good but not as good as 1st . VD returns a Luc & must do battle again . He tries 2 b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle . VD has a kid this time from Ally W. , good it showed a pic of them 2 . Goldberg was cool , he does his famous move-forgot what its called cause i don 't watch wrestling-sucks . VD & Goldberg had some good fights . It was the ending like the 1st but just not that good . VD does his best move in his career , like always-the HELICOPTER KICK . Even though , the final ending should 've been longer .

" " " Lets swap Murders- your wife , my father " " - seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey . Guy , a solid , respectable tennis player , whose problem is that his wife , the flirtatious Miriam , won 't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter Anne , laughs the whole conversation off as a joke . The following week he isn 't laughing any more . In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense , Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her . As he does , her glasses fall off and we see the murder eerily reflected twice through her lenses . Cold hearted and amoral Bruno , his part of the deal completed , approaches an appalled Guy expecting , even pressuring him into ' doing his bit . ' Matters are not helped when Anne 's precocious and outspoken younger sister turns up suspecting Guy of Miriam 's murder . So accused of a murder he didn 't commit and expected to commit another , what is Guy going to do ? The power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature - and this Hitchcock does to perfection . , " positive
" First , let me state that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd ; that 's why I was curious to check out this , her debut role . No argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent . I guess I can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story . However , I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails.By the halfway point , I found myself thinking , " " How much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl , idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop , rearranging the merchandise ? " " It seemed to go on forever ! Then , I thought , maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event . No such luck . The movie continues it 's bland , boring , uneventful story all the way to the end.I 'm not saying this because I 'm an action-junkie . I like all kinds of movies , especially romantic-comedies . But I expect to be entertained.Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor 's bad home movies . Depressing ! I just don 't get how anyone could like this movie . Zero-entertainment value . The longest 114 minutes of my life . , " negative
" I watch lots of scary movies ( or at least they try to be ) and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie I have ever had to make myself try to sit through . I never knew the depths of Masacism until I rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive . I am a fan of Julian Sans , but this is worse than I would hope for him.On the other hand the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and I had yet to see what pain looked like first hand . Perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction , but then again I know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me , especially when we had to turn the video off , and that simply is NOT done with our watching ( we had to make one exception obviously ) . If it were up for a remake , I 'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1 % of the original incorporated into it . That 's all . , " negative
" Any movie that has nude scenes of Karen Allen and I 'm still so bored I walk out , that is a stinker ! Karen gets stuck in Paris , and befriends a sissily-handsome French man with whom she is having sex soon . Of course he 's married , ( " " But , cheri , why should that be a problem ? " " ) What could be an interesting clash of cultures is ( believe it or not ) just dull . I walked out . Maybe the movie got a lot better after I left ; but it would have had to have gotten a LOT better to make up for a rotten beginning.My advice , if you find yourself in this , run , do not walk , for the exit . Save your time and your energy . Most assuredly save your money . It 's a shame the production company didn 't save its money . , " negative
" I would like to comment on the movie April Love . It 's one of my all time favorites because my father , Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer . I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington , KY , where we were living at the time to make April Love . My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man . I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered , and lo and behold he came home w / the script . How exciting is that ! Also , a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the ones shown at the amusement park . It 's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again , and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio . Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w / all the sex , foul language and violence . It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus ... , " positive
" Although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my DVD rack and i don 't know why . I think i like it because the moral of the story is ' television is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life ' . For those of you who do decide to heed the message then you should try reading the book , its nothing like the film at all . To ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded Richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building , killing himself , everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time . I read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 9 / 11 . , " positive
" Sonny Chiba , as everyone knows , is the man . In this film , he portrays Mas Oyama ( 1923-1994 ) , a real martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare handsí˜šand won ( interesting guyí˜šlook him up ) . Anyway , Chiba only kills one bull in the film but it 's a memorable scene and as the liner notes say , right up there with the zombie vs. shark scene in Zombi ! The film also offers up loads of hand-to-hand combat and a decent plot to boot , though I don 't believe all of it is true . This film is the first of the Oyama trilogy Chiba made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action . Finally , three neat little tidbits ; part of the opening theme was used in Kill Bill Volume 1 , Oyama himself appears in the opening sequences , and that is because he trained Chiba in real life for five years ! , " positive
" I did a review for this director 's fictional recreation about BTK . I had also seen this movie and it was terrible . Please save your money and time . This movie was terrible and this director is untalented . I do not understand how he is funding these movies . They are horrible . I have decided to make sure that I check who the writer , director , and producer are , and if this director 's name pops up I will not waste my money . There is nothing worse than renting a movie on a Friday night , making the popcorn , and then realizing you have been duped by creative art on the front of the movie box . Stay away . So I guess I should make up some stuff to fill in the lines ? I have always checked IMDb for reviews before , but I think I will not anymore . This is ridiculous . I have been corrected in my reviews far too many times . Not enough lines ? You may cancel my account . Your site is a pain . , " negative
" A bad bad movie ... terrible plot , hinges on Bolo Yeung 's charater , but he speaks maybe 20 words in the entire movie and only has one fight scene - still in great shape considering he was also in the kung fu classic " " Enter The Dragon " " Interesting to see William Zabka ( " " Johnny " " from The Karate Kid ) in another martial-arts role . , " negative
" A lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie , but I feel this is only secondary . It 's really about living in Japan , and it really succeeds.I spent a few years living in Japan , and I suppose the reason that this movie didn 't do too well is that you sort of have to have experienced Japan to get it . I was watching this with a well-travelled friend who 's never been to Japan , and he noted that many of the events in the movie were so ludicrous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief . My reply was that those events were the absolute unvarnished truth about life in Japan ! I think that this movie is definitely worth watching , especially if you 've lived in Japan or are interested in it . , " positive

" I have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life , but none are coming to mind right now . Hell Ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that Tarantino brought back , and did right , in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs . The problem with Hell Ride is , unlike PF and RD , the story is garbage and so is character development . How many movies does Bishop think he can blatantly steal from ? The brief case in Pulp Fiction , the air gun in No Country , etc. etc . Speaking of Bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie ? I couldn 't help but laugh at those scenes where he 's standing with his pelvis trusted out , desperately trying to seem like some hardened biker . Nothing in this movie is believable . And why Dennis Hopper ? Did they really need the Easy Rider motif too ? I blame Larry Bishop , for his horrible plot and dialogue , not to mention his failed attempt at the leading role . Don 't bother watching this movie , it 's a waste of time . , " negative
" An interesting thriller that has Paul Winfield as a detective on the case of a murder . Paul Winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease , it was hard to tell the man was even acting . Maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice / narrator of " " City Confidential " , " Winfield ends his career with a so-so movie ; but as always , Winfield shines . A treat to watch.Erika Eliniak is well , Erika Eliniak , nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department . Though , to be fair , this is one of her better efforts.Bottom line : a watchable thriller that shouldn 't be missed by any Paul Winfield fan . A decent telefilm to help send Paul Winfield off to celluloid heaven . What an actor . He will be missed . , " positive
" Dolemite is a blaxploitation film about , well , Dolemite and his army of kung fu killer women , led by Queen Bee .

" So , I got a hold of this as an assignment for Trent Harris , who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the U of U. I guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film ... The documentary section at the beginning dragged on . Yes , the kid is a nut-job from no where , but that 's not good enough to keep it interesting.Seeing Sean Penn dressed as a ONJ is the only highlight ... and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor.When Crispin Glover takes on Larry , the story-telling was better , but I just couldn 't take anymore ... , " negative
" I don 't know where most of you were at , but where I watched the film we didn 't have people singing as some have told they experienced , we had people laughing , mostly at the campy plot line , the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of Brosnan . The only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs . I was a DJ in the seventies and even went to the ABBA concert at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in Sept of 79 , so I did appreciate them then and I still do now . But this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce . The sequences were so poorly staged , the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be Meryl 's worst production . I cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage . So save your money , wait for it to come out on DVD and then maybe spend your money on something better , like cat litter . , " negative
" This was a top-notch movie with a top-notch cast . Danny Glover , Tony Danza , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , and especially Christopher Lloyed are well-cast in this charming movie about real-life angels helping the Angels baseball team . You never know , it could happen . I loved Lloyd 's role in it . He was hilarious . The story is about turning your life around , as the kid 's belief in Angels helped turn around angry , hardened , and embittered manager Glover see the best in people . The movie was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching your dreams . It was funny , charming , touching , and sad , all very nicely done . You will like ( or love ) it . I guarantee . * * * out of * * * * , " positive
" Honestly , at first , I watched this movie because of the gratuitous sex scenes I heard it possesses but by actually watching the film , it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there . Truly , it is one of the most well-crafted and touching movies I 've ever watched . I 'm a teenage bisexual and the film spoke to me about my predicaments - sex , religion , love , acceptance , etc . It gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my self and others around me who love me for who I am . Cox really handled the movie well by sprinkling dozes of heart-warming lines and a bit of sexuality in it . It made the movie more interesting . Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain but I don 't agree myself . Brokeback Mountain has more drama while Latter Days is well-balanced . , " positive
" This wilfully bizarre adaptation of Borges short story is typical Cox . His strong visual sense is , as usual , undone by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast . The film is definitely in the surreal tradition of Bunuel 's Mexican period , and looks at times like a poor man 's take on Lars Von Trier 's Elements of Crime . Cox 's apparent preference for single takes , jump cuts , and ambient sound recording all work against the film 's effectiveness . Worth a look but ultimately disappointing . , " negative
" This is just one more example of the absolute genius of Gene Wilder . He wrote and starred in this terrific mystery . No one could have done it better . The suspense was palpable throughout . I wish Mr. Wilder would grace us with another of these . I have enjoyed everything I have ever seen Mr. Wilder in but I had no idea how truly talented he was until I saw " " Murder in a Small Town , " " and this follow-on . He truly has a firm grasp on what audiences want and how to deliver it in his writing and , of course , in his brilliant acting . His subtle wit comes through in spades . I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and / or Gene Wilder 's film work . His star just gets brighter and brighter . , " positive
" Notable because of it 's notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous Maruschka Detmers takes her young lover 's penis from his trousers and into her mouth . Even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride . Detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged , insatiable delight , wandering about her flat nude . Dressed , partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love , sexual passion , philosophy and politics . For me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fiancì±• is released whilst fellow terrorists are released , she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps , beautifully of course ! , " positive
" This solid little horror film is actually one of Renny Harlin 's best . The story is pretty routine stuff , but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive ; in fact , the ghost story is almost an afterthought . The real horror comes from the prison setting itself , and Renny H. spares no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling , leaking , rat-infested old hellhole ( with a sadistic warden , too ! ) Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role , supported by some very authentic-looking prisoners ( there are no pretty boys in this cast . ) Horror fans should check this one out . , " negative
" I wasn 't sure where this was headed until the ending. when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to European wimps and the United Nations . What a load of right-wing crud ! Incidentally , the bit about Canada joining the US didn 't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed . The only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for President ( but they could have just made him American and dispensed with that ) . In any event , this was a load of bull and not worth your time . If you wan 't to see this kind of thing done well , check out the brilliant BBC political thriller " " State of Play .

" The movie was very moving . It was tender , and funny at the same time . The scenery was absolutely beautiful ! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award winning performances . Olympia Dukakis was great . I understand due to the story line her part had to be brief , but I did wish I could have seen more of her-she is a true pro.You will be able to recall experiences from your own life , hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie . We were fortunate to see Paul Reiser at a Q and A after the viewing . He is a wonderful man , clever , eloquent and a " " real Person " . " It was truly an enjoyable night out ! This is a must see movie . You will be so grateful you went . , " positive
" I see people writing about how great this movie was . It was horrible ! The acting was sub-par at best . It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo . Where the hell did they get the money ? Anyway , I wanted to learn more about the Titanic ; why it sank , what was running through a lot of people 's minds ; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff . Does anyone realize that certain people didn 't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off ? No , you don 't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked ( did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid ? ) .I did cry in during one scene , though . The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship . It looked like pool water ! I 'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn 't even make the water from the ocean look real ? unbelievable ... Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank .. Just ridiculous . This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor outdid it in the " " Nothing to Do With Reality " " department . , " negative
This movie is so bad there are not words to describe it . If I got a video camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half it would be a heck of a lot more entertaining than this . The plot is so dull and unimaginitive it is not even worth mentioning . The best part of the movie was when the credits roled and I got a chuckle out of knowing the lead actors name was James Bond III . Just trust me and stay far away from this trash heap ! , negative
" Abysmal pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre . Lousy audio thankfully obscures the dumb dialog . And it 's awfully talky for a movie about people who don 't speak English . There 's no adventure to be found here ; it 's a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and one wild animal attack that happens in flashback.Three pale-face dopes wander the African wilderness and encounter warring man-hungry tribes of Amazons . These wild women have advanced out of the Stone Age only so far as to invent makeup , shoes , and underarm hair removal technology . Despite their desperation for " " hus-bahnd , " " the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weaker ones.The only thing of interest , as if there were any question , is the assortment of young women clad in animal skins cleverly designed like the bathing suits of 1951 . Plenty of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripless 1950s stripper moves . No nudity or appreciable violence . On the other hand , you may be humming the catchy native song for days . , " negative
" Personally , I think that the film was done very professionally , I loved the choreography and the acting . The plot is also gripping and mysterious . The film itself is very emotional , and what I liked about it most is that it makes you think afterwards . Antonio Gades has absolutely lived his role to the end , and I must say that it 's one of my favourite pictures and Saura is a wonderful director . , " positive
" STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history . This second appearance of Mickey Mouse ( following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year ) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking . This is because it was the first sound cartoon . While you don 't yet hear Mickey speak , there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.Now if this were just an important historical film , it would be worth seeing--especially to lovers of animation . However , after seeing the short again after about 25 years , I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is . While Mickey and Minnie behave a bit odd compared to the characters we have grown to love ( thanks mostly to the kooky mind and talent of animator Ub Iwerks ) , there is an infectious charm about the film . It 's just adorable seeing Mickey playing " " Turkey in the Straw " " in a highly imaginative ( if occasionally cruel ) way . Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey 's best films even after 80 wonderful years . , " positive
" I got hold of this film on DVD with the title Evil Never Sleeps , it gives front cover billing to Carrie Ann Moss , but she plays such a minor character that I didn 't really notice her in the film.I 'm afraid that I consider this one of the worst purchases I have ever made . The dialogue was stilted and the delivery wooden , I found the acting to be disconnected from the plot . Graham 's performance to me was of someone who 's wondering whether she 's left the gas on at home.All in all both my wife and I found this film painful to watch , and it is not a valuable addition to my collection , watch it at your peril , but spending 90 minutes having your fingernails pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time . , " negative
" This is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so clever they have a story that fits the time . Remember the all-around political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading to the Watergate and a little later ? Most movies trying to cash in on made-for-TV ' o so powerful , o so mind numbing ' conspiracies were in fact caught in their own navel-gazing attitude.I was never a fan of The Conversation which I find as much dated as others conspiracy stints of the time but Coppola was true to his main character and Hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe . I mean these conspiracy movies are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir heroes . Lots of questions unanswered , lots of dis-communication ... Well this takes at least Bergman to build a movie about such un-visual bases.The Next Man is a perfect example of its time : one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy tightening its web around him . Neither part is interesting in itself and the whole doesn 't get any better . In fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences piling up ' watcha that ' murders without ever advancing any storyline . Pedestrian directing at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively brought under the viewer 's eyes . , " negative
" This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it just looks so horribly bad . And indeed , we couldn 't take most of it . There was a lot of fast-forwarding going on.But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist ( her name somehow slips my mind at this time ) . CRIPES . I 've never watched a single scene from a film so many times ( I 'm estimating forty or so ) . And I 've never laughed so hard in my life . You see , Englund has this thing for showing off his loins . I last saw the film a couple months ago , but I can 't stop laughing as I type . Anyway , the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl , Englund riding a horse naked , and some mysterious woman fellating a snake 's head . This is absolute genius . You 've got to see it for yourself . , " negative
" I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young . Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child , I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery . This movie was ( and still is ) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery 's work or not . Elizabeth always shines in her roles , such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden . Her performance in The Victim as Kate , a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm , with a killer after her is brilliant . If you like exciting suspenseful thrillers than this is one movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end . Another great performance well worth mentioning is that of Eileen Heckhart who plays the eerie and suspicious housekeeper . Unfortunately like most of Miss Montgomery 's movies , The Victim is not available on DVD and I believe that although it was released on VHS some years ago , it is a rarity these days . I was lucky to have taped it when it was aired on television some ten years ago and so have a nice copy of this very good movie . A must see ! , " positive
" David " " master of debonair " " Niven plays the Big Boss ( IVAN ) who preys upon the unfortunate Richard Jordan ( PINKY ) by forcing the hapless ex-con to exploit his ill-found new position in a bank . Elke Sommer ( Miss PELHAM ) most effectively provides the female interest , whom Pinkie cannot simply cannot resist.It seems they were unable to decide on one name for this film so instead they used four .... makes sense ? ? ? Sadly , this turn out to be one of Niven 's last roles.Overall , this film is fun and well worth watching if you manage to catch one of its rare or late night TV screenings . , " positive
" This final installment of the " " Airport " " franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn 't a slapstick comedy , like " " Airplane " . " George Kennedy shooting a flare gun out an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles was comical . What would happen to your hand if you held it out a window at mach two speed ? You 'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm . The passengers were unintentionally hilarious , as was the interior of the plane . The sophisticated French woman coming on to slobby George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy coming on to Ernest Borgnine . Ain 't gonna happen . Susan Blakely , a talented and unappreciated actress , did not get any points on her resume for this one . Neither did Robert Wagner . This movie was so lousy it seemed surreal . , " negative
" so if a guy meets you and he says ' I want you to look at my erection ! ' don 't be alarmed , maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built. yes ! that 's the only thing what happens in this movie ! it 's like the worst Warholian BEEP I ever saw ! it 's like filming the inside of your toilet before you flush it , in fact , it 's less interesting to look at than that.but if you do watch Lennon 's Erection , be warned that he put a lot of background noise in it too . I mean , really , it 's as if the building is being attacked by space mutants from hell or something ! in the meanwhile , the building in progress is growing up as an erection can do too ( in almost 20 minutes , what an accomplishment ) .so if someone does ask you to watch his erection , be sure he wants to videotape it all . , " negative
" For avid Sci-Fi fans this movie is just what you 've been waiting for . Watching this movie gets you lost into the characters , especially Riddick , the movies bad guy . This is the case where you root for the bad guy and want to see him live and win . As you watch the survivors struggle to stay alive you long to see who lives and how they survive these unknown creatures that have taken over this planet . An excellent movie , Vin Diesel did a wonderful job as convict Riddick and the acting and suspense were ravishing.A + , " positive
" Two kinds of movies we like are ( 1 ) westerns , and ( 2 ) movies from 30 or 40 years ago . We ought to have liked A Man Called Sledge ; BUT ..... BUT ... this picture is disagreeable , annoying and stupid from start to finish . Since there is nobody in the story ( good or bad ) to warm up to , there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested . No camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold , and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it . Sledge has a pretty girl friend , but there 's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no-account pig.The film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score , and from extremely bad writing and direction by Vic Morrow.Of the last 30 older movies rented from Netflix or Video Vault , this was the rock bottom , the only true dud in the bunch . , " negative
" Sometimes a premise starts out good , but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention-deficit disorder , it devolves into an incongruous mess . And for three well-respected actors who have made better work before and after , this is a mortal shame.So let 's see . Premise : a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop . Interesting to say the least . Make the encroaching cop a little disturbing , why not . It was well done in THE HAND WHO ROCKS THE CRADLE and SINGLE WHITE FEMALE , and it 's a proved ticket to a successful thriller.Now herein lies the dilemma . Create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous , or throw any semblance to reality , amp up the shock factor , and make this cop so extreme -- an ultra bad variation of every other super-villain that 's hit cinemas since the silent age.The producers , and directors , chose the latter . Thus is the resulting film -- badly made , with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they 've essayed before , and nothing much amounting to even less . , " negative
" William H. Macy is brilliant as Everyman caught in a desperate situation . Starts off with a bang and never lets up . Twists and surprises are fresh , unpredictable . Use of film noir clips and frequent quotes and references to 30 's and 40 's flicks makes this a delightful " " must " " for movie buffs . , " positive
" Adrian has just gone out of the asylum , being rich and with no parents , his life seems empty . One day , he meets Gonzalo , a poor boy whom mother is prostitute . Desperate for earning some money , Gonzalo helps Adrian to search about his life and who where his parents . This is a movie from a new director , and it is perfectly clear in most of the film : scenes not correctly directed , dialogues a little forced , some incoherences in the script ... Anyway , the ending is unexpectedly well done ( well , just a little ) and that saves a little the film . Actors are known and with great quality , nevertheless , they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting ; all of them have done better papers in other film . The film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends . Of course there are lots of worse films , but , sure , there are many many better ones . , " negative

" This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof . Its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and not at all funny.Even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from India who 's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren 't really funny . The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn 't get any laughs either.The plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof . It 's a classic and trite sports theme . But alas , the screenplay was too weak for ANY cast to pull it off . And this cast is no exception.There is gratuitous use of women in bikinis and underwear , so it 's not all bad from that aspect.But Animal House or Talladega Nights , this is not . , " negative
" This is a film that left me breathless ........ wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions . With todays " " evil doer " " mantra clouding reality , it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs.Casting was impeccable , the scenery simply marvelous . The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this ( except it 's music ) is unforgivable.The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey .

" Crackerjack , starring Mick Malloy & Judith Lucy - both part of the cast in the early 90 's Saturday night comedy show " " The Late Show " , " Bill Hunter , an Australian movie icon and John Clarke , who we still see regularly on Australian TV along side Brian Dawe.Crackerjack , losely is about a guy in his early 30 's ( Jack Simpson , played by Mick Malloy ) who pays his yearly memebership at the local bowls club in order to get a few car park spaces for which he uses himself and rents out to others as cheap inner city parking.The club falls on hard times , and pulls all the resources and memebers together it can , Jack gets a phone call telling him to turn up to next Saturday 's bowls match or lose his membership ( and conseqently his car park space ) I wont spoil the rest , but the film is funny , light hearted and contains everything a good aussie film should.If your not Australian , then some of the jokes and humour will no doubt baffle you , if you are an Aussie - do yourself a favor and sit yourself down to Crackerjack .. Its now available on DVD , I already have my copy ! 10 / 10 .. Awesome flick ! , " positive
" Julie Brown hilariously demolishes Madonna 's attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival Madonna 's own . Cinematography and sets are top notch.Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own injections of comedy that enhances and compliments this film . Appearances by Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale , as themselves , is an added bonus.It 's hard to tell if Brown 's performance is meant to insult or playfully tease Madonna , though I hardly think the Material Girl would find humor in it.My Favorite line : " " Why don 't you come here ( to the Phillipines ) ; all they eat is dog and I 'm a vegetarian . " " , " positive
" Highly flawed but just about watchable ' comedy ' that runs like a Farrelly brothers reject . The most criminal thing about it though is the casting . I couldn 't for one minute believe Jerry O Connell and Jake Busey in the role of superstuds , who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat , nor could I believe ( the very beautiful ) Shannon Elizabeth as a streetwise tough cop ! . Story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions , although , the ' gross out ' , meant to be ' shock comic ' scenes , ( one involving an amputated testicle , and another set in a sperm bank ) are just plain awful . If this film is on TV then its probably worth watching if you are extremely bored , but please don 't waste your money renting it ! ! , " negative
" I never comment on a film , but I have to say that this was one of the worst films that I have ever seen . I feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students , but this was horrible ! I did not buy the lead actress and felt I was in acting class with her while she was on film . Her decisions were very safe and I feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions . The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves . The end may have made a little more sense if there was someone narrating the events and not a song . I love Patsy Cline but she her songs appear quite frequently in films . Maybe the song selection could have been a little more original . The song " " crazy " " was such a clichì±• . As I said before I never comment on films and have seen my share of good and bad , but this was the worst . Sorry . , " negative
" I was the Production Accountant on this movie , and I also got to do some voice-over work on it , so I 'm not entirely unbiased , but if it were awful , I would say so . I thought it was a fun film , not a critically acclaimed masterpiece , by any means , but there were plenty of laughs along the way . The Bible states that laughter does good like a medicine , so watching this movie could be good for your health.So many of the actors in this picture hadn 't yet reached their peak at the time we made this film . Susan Sarandon , of course , is one who has since gone on to much greater fame . Melanie Mayron was seen on TV on a weekly basis as a photographer in the " " Thirty-Something " " TV drama series . Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger , still haunting people 's dreams . One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor , who played the sheriff . He was an excellent comedic actor , and a truly nice , sincere person . We all had fun working on this show , and I think that fun comes through . , " positive
" We have an average family . Dad 's a famous rapper , we have the " " rebelious teenage daughter " , " the adopted white kid , and the cute little kid . And we have careless housemaid , what show has had a housemaid like that ? Do we have a messed-up Brady Bunch ? Yay ! When it first came out I thought it was really cool , mostly because I was young . The music was bad . The raps were so bad and they were too g-rated . All of his raps were about his family and friends and problems . The dad was kind of the " " Danny from Full House " " type of dad . Always gave the advice out . But he wasn 't a clean freak . They had a house-keeper for that . Remember ? The plots were basically Lil ' Romeo was in trouble of some sort , or ... not that 's it . Oh and maybe some preteen drama . Yeah that stuff is good . Not really . But its still a good show for kids . But Nikelodean could do better . , " negative
" " " Sir " " John Gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one . ; This is one of those films , I suppose , that is considered " " art , " " but don 't be fooled ..... it 's garbage . Stick to the " " art " " you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like this.In this masterpiece , Giegud recites Shakespeare 's " " The Tempest " " while the camera pans away to nude people. one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool . Wow , this is heady stuff and real " " art , " " ain 't it ? ? That 's just one example . Most of the story makes no sense , is impossible to follow and , hence , is one that Liberal critics are afraid to say they didn 't " " understand " " so they give it high marks to save their phony egos . You want Shakespeare ? Read his books . , " negative
Apparently I am swimming against the tide of the glowing comments on this film . I have not seen it since I was 4 or 5 years old but there is one thing I remember distinctly ... The Bunyip was TERRIFYING ! ! ! Nightmare inducing terrifying . With the creepy music and the little girl and kangaroo running / hopping away for their lives ... As a kid I also remember the animated Hobbit ... no worries . Watership down ? Didn 't blink an eye . Dot and the Kangaroo ? It still haunts my dreams . And I have several friends the same age who also think it was massively creepy . Maybe we can get a group rate on therapy.In short : one freaky film for its time . , negative
Some bad reviews here for this and I understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than most.I thought that this worked in a way because afterwards I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isn 't it ? I would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven . David Hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like Last House.Other than that - worth a look . , positive
" The core issues at play ( God & Satan / Good & Evil ) can be & should be tremendously compelling ( as demonstrated through thousands of works of art / music / literature / film ) . End of Days , unfortunately , is nothing but a 2Dimensional Cartoon . Byrne 's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to Arnold 's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes.The single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the Gabriel Byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife ? girlfriend ? It is both erotically charged & repellent -- modernizing the vampirish themes , the seductive power of evil . , " negative
" I don 't think this movie had the effect on me that was intended : seeing American soldiers shooting wounded soldiers from the other side , and punching wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them into making them talk made me root for the other side . It certainly made the US forces look anything like " " the good guys " . " Was this supposed to be acceptable ? , " negative
" Yes sure , this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it . It 's a good effort , the killings aren 't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie , what a scream queen , Jennifer Ritchkoff . For a low budget movie the effects are nicely done , okay , sometimes you can guess how it is done . Some people have problems with the use of the camera , I can 't see what 's wrong with that . It 's so strange that so many people dislike this movie , I really enjoyed it . Of course the script isn 't original but give me one that is , I mean , so many slashers are made in the woods. maybe it is all predictable but it 's a worth see , I have seen a lot worser , I can tell you that , " negative
" Up until the last few minutes of the movie , I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars . However , the ending is so terrible and " " Hollywoodized " " that it completely undermines the first 80 % of the movie.The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles . The Captain , Gene Hackman , is all for launching , while his first officer , Denzel Washington , is in favor of confirming the launch orders first . The problem is , to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys . Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub . Eventually , the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched . Cool . However , here comes the part that just doesn 't ring true . After they are back on land and go before a review board , Washington and Hackman ( who 'd just spent half the movie trying to kill each other ) shake hands and are all buddy buddy ! Huh ? ! Too trite an ending to make the movie worth while for me . , " negative
" the acting is good.thats the positives out of the way ! SOSN is shallow and superficial.Almost all the characters are middle class and English.The gay men are depicted as fickle sexual predators aiming to use children in their empty lives.This film could only appeal to people who know hampstead heath and would get minor satisfaction from pointing out any landmarks.There is no time to engage with the characters and has a result you really don , t care about them , Catherine Tate at the height of her comedic fame stars as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on screen for about the same time as her Nana sketches failed to convince , however if she had said " " what a f * * * * * * liberty " " i would have agreed I 'd rather take a walk in the Park ; unintelligent rubbish ! , " negative
" Like the above poster , I got burned on the title thinking I was getting the other Piranha ... This movie is everything the above poster said and worse ...

Make sure the movie you buy is the one you want ... and not this one.The movie I bought was labeled " " Piranha " " and not " " Piranha , Piranha ! " " which is what it actually is ...

For once a Barbie movie that is good . I 'm 18 and a embarrassed to say this but I 'm hooked on these movies . I hated Barbie when I was younger but the movies I love . Shiver is so cute and I 've fallen in love with him . He 's so cute as the polar bear and totally in love with Aiden . Oh man I 'm in love with Shiver . I love Annika determination not to give up on hope and eventfully it works . I love this movie and hopefully they will be other good ones . Barbie & Swan Lake is other brilliant movie .

" I was pleased to see that she had black hair ! I 've been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories.I was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer , it didn 't spoil it at all . In fact I watched the film twice in one day , a sure sign that it was up to standard . This is what I do with books that I like as well.I thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip . I would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly . Has he actually read the books ? I thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation . , " positive
" There are four great movie depicting the Vietnam War . They are ( in no particular order : Apocalypse Now , Born on the Fourth of July , Platoon , and finally Tigerland . All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it . Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War . The character of Boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war , and the absurdity of it . This has been done in many war movies , but rarely in boot camp . Also , this is a very complex character , whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie . The character of Boz makes this movie so good . It is a shame it did not get a major release . It belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles . , " positive
" This movie is absolutely horrible ! I thought because it had good actors in it like Gabrielle Union , Hill Harper , and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams . The movie is long , and drags on with a documentary style of showing Gabrielle Union , who has died in the movie , talking about her family ; which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who 's who , and who 's related to who . I would not recommend this movie to anyone , and I wish I could take it back where I got it from . I fell asleep from time to time because of the boredom . Do not waste your time or money on this movie . It could had been more true to life with more drama , and less boredom . , " negative
" Dumbland is not for all . In fact Dumbland maybe in for nobody except Lynch and that 's what make it funny and a collective cartoon . Violent ? Yes . Profanity ? Yes . Absurd ? Yes . A piece of garbage ? Never . Dumbland is a wonderful picture of some Americans that don 't have brains and hit wife and kids for fun . From Mì±•xico I can say I love it ! My favorite episodes are : 1- My teeths are bleeding , all the noise around and violence make me wanna scream and put me behind my bed . 2- Get the stick ! Yeah baby get it and learn a lesson : some people never be thankful for your actions . 3- Ants . The more Lynch episode of all , music , surrealism and a very sweet revenge ... , " positive
" ( Review in English , since Swedish is not allowed ) I saw this movie with extremely low expectations , and I can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them.As much as I loved to see Janne " " Loffe " " Karlsson on the big screen again , the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water , isn 't original or funny . The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable , the ones that ain 't , is just plain boring . I smiled like three times during the entire film.The placement of Swedish Findus products is ( unintentionally ) funny , why not just a big sign saying ; " " Findus made it happen ! " . " Gì² ta Kanal 2 doesn 't need to be seen at the cinema or on DVD , just wait for it to air on TV , it wont take too long . , " negative
" What this film has is its realism , you really do get the feeling screenwriter James Slater has been doing his homework on the subject of downhill skiing while director Michael Ritchie shoots the movie in a fly on the wall documentary style . However the problem is unless you 're a big fan of the sport there 's not a lot in DOWNHILL RACER to grab your attention .Before anyone asks why I watched it , I did so because it featured the great Gene Hackman in an early role but that 's not really a good enough reason for watching , " negative
" Although I am not a Michael Jackson fan , I like some of his early songs and some from Jackson 5 too . ' Thriller ' is one of his great songs and it comes from the best-selling album ever with the same title . As for the video , it is awesome , one of Michael 's best , but also very eccentric and weird.There is a story behind this video , but it 's so complex that even I can 't fully understand it . It 's freaky . The freakiest things are Jackson 's transformation into a werewolf , his evil red eyes at the end ( like a werewolf ) and those dead people dancing.The video is very dark , thrilling , chilly and original . There are great sceneries and settings . The music itself is full of life and rhythm , characteristic from the good old pop from the 80 's.I like Vincent Price 's soliloquy . He does a great narration with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laughter at the end is awesome ! My favorite videos of the ' King of Pop ' are " " Billie Jean " " and " " Don 't stop ' til you get enough " " ( both among his best songs ) . , " positive
" To all the reviewers on this page , I would have to say this movie is worth seeing . So It was made in 1972 , so what . The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time . People who didn 't study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball . Compared to the modern series , ' Left Behind , ' ( Which is made for our time right now ) it does look cheezy . However , the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion , which again was over 30 years in the past . BUT . The message that is sent in this film is very powerful , and carefully preserved . There is just so much to say , but I refuse to say it . ( for fear of spoiling it ) So go out and see this film ! If you don 't like the message that it sends , then you have issues , that need some attention ! , " positive
" I really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star , because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it 's almost worth the price of the rental . The acting , if you want to call it that , is so stilted and contrived that it makes Ed Wood 's actors appear life like . " " Sammy , " " the lone black character , must be Mimi 's husband in real life because he appears in her other films , but he has zero acting ability . His lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery , though I suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character . His old man make up in her other turkey ( " " Pushed To The Limit " " ) is no-budget , junior high school quality , with cotton ball eyebrows and white spray painted hair.I cannot fathom anyone actually buying this video , unless people like to throw their own Mystery Science Theater parties and need a copy of something like this on hand . It really is Beyond Fear-- it 's actually Beyond Funny . , " negative
" I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo . Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie , not just a bit part , made me happy.Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn 't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired , but Arnold is an excellent actor , I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired.I love Arnold Vosloo , and he made the film viewable . Otherwise , I would have written it off as another lousy film.I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary , but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good . But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad . There are some glitches in the film ( continuity ) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film.All in all I enjoyed the film , because Arnold Vosloo was in it.Jackie , " negative
" This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth . Sadly , though , after priming us with this , the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on Christianity , and pretty much focusing on the easy targets.The writer / director clearly has some issues with the Church ( he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger ) and this film seems to be his form of release . It 'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded , but as a whole , the movie is disappointing . , " negative
" I can not quite understand why any of the " " reviewers " " gave this documentary " " 0 " " other than for political reasons . No , the film did not investigate both " " sides " " of the story , but then surely one film in favour of Chavez against the tides of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance out the narrative overall ( especially given A. the history of CIA involvement in Latin America in fermenting civil unrest - google National Security Archive and B. the coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly faked scenes of Chavez supporters shooting non-existent opponents ) . What is most amazing about this film is the fact that the film makers stayed in the presidential palace all of the way though the coup - surely a first in documentary making - images of a coup from both sides ! ! ! , " positive
" I just got back from the GLBT Film Festival at the AMC Loews 34th in NY . A friend told me about this film . Audience response was very positive ! Lots of good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of realization . Top notch in every area . A movie that makes you think , and then makes you realize how lucky we 'd all be if we could turn back time and live without shame or guilt . I imagine this will come close to , if not win , the audience favorite award ! What was most surprising was the fact the the movie appears to start off as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the very group it started to satirize . There isn 't any mean spirited humor at the expense of one group , just a slow realization that we would all be better off if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started off with . , " positive
" I had just reached thirteen when I first saw this series and I am watching it again , on DVD , over thirty years later . The pictures over the opening credits have never left me . It has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it . My parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me , and we always discussed the programme afterwards . It gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks I got in our school 's public exams ! Sir Laurence Olivier 's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect . I get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the Second World War . I cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it . Maybe an similar Cold War series could now be contemplated , although who could replace Sir Laurence is difficult to imagine.Buy it ! , " positive
" One of the worst movies I have ever seen . Excruciatingly slow-moving , boring and stupid . Lots of juvenile bathroom-humor , drawn out into painful tedium .

" I saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because I felt it was a waste of time . The idea to make a film through the eyes of a headsman - one of the " " evil guys " " throughout most fantasy and medieval films - is great and offers plenty of possibilities but ... the film couldn 't catch one of them . I was not feeling for any of the characters , the plot was all too predictable ( to the point that I followed it ) and the second leap of time in the storyline made me quit . Those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a headsman in the middle Ages , a social outcast to that time , might be disappointed . , " negative
" I 'm sorry to say this , but the acting in this film is horrible . The dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever . Perhaps I got the " " dress rehearsal " " version by mistake . The director over-uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves . The story is pretty well written , and the fight sequences are actually better than I have seen in many action films . The fights seem pretty real . But all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point-blank automatic weapon fire , grenades , morter rounds , and bazookas . The enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I have ever seen , especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards , and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet . Those bazookas need serious site calibration . , " negative
As Most Off You Might off Seen Star Wars : Return Off The Jedi You May Knows Its A Good Movie But As You Might Have Seen On Video They M | might have a party At The end And They Just Probably End The Movie with the party with no a spirits or anything But on the original one ( Live TV ) When they are Partying But before i say more when Ben obi-wan dies in the Imperial Ship Or Death Star They Saw him Disappear And Yoda Dies From Either Old Age Or Internal Illness But because Luke killed Darth Vader ( Real Name : Anakin Skywalker ) When They All Are Partying At The end when Luke Or Someone Stops the Spirits Off Ben And Yoda Stands Starring At Him And Smiling While Another Spirit Appears Is its Darth Vader but not as A Sith As The Old Usual Selve off Him And Started Smiling with Ben And Yoda I reckon That made the movie ending a little bit interesting But the Producers or anyone should off made a spirit off Padme And Mace Windu And Other Jedis that got killed with Younglings Under There Arms in the back ground , positive
" Really bad . Why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery . I like comedies as much as the next man and I LOVED " " A Christmas Story . " " The fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writer 's memoirs has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level . Charles Grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters . For another it does not seem to have the same pacing -- it just doesn 't flow well . Everything seems tired and forced . The joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here -- you just want the movie to end . I wouldn 't even recommend this movie for curiosity-seekers who enjoyed " " A Christmas Story . " " It 's that bad . 1 / 10 . , " negative
" This movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else I 've ever seen . Really , if you are a Tolkien fan , rent it just to laugh at it with your friends .

" I 'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K , so I waited anxiously to see this episode . I 'll comment on the movie first , then the MST3K episode . The recipe for this movie : take talented actors , rich and beautiful Shakespeare material , and a $ 1.25 budget . Mix well , then drain of all life and movement , until dull and lifeless . Serve cold in a big , plain stone cauldron . Movie , I give 3 out of 10 , because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit . Okay , now the MST3K episode . I 'll admit it , the first time I saw it , I fell asleep halfway through . I understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well . However , when I watched it a second time , I realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines I missed the first time around . The trick with this episode is : listen carefully ! It takes a couple of viewings to catch each line . Give it a second chance , and You 'll see what I mean . MST3K Episode : 7 1 / 2 out of 10 . , " negative
" This film wasn 't programmed in Italian cinemas , I have seen it at a manifestation called " " fantafestival " . " I find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark , the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there 's no suspence in the film . Music is completely out of the story and I don 't have words to describe the visual effects.If you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting , but a few minutes later it becomes busy.The story is interesting but the development needs a complete review . , " negative
If you watched the series and love the league as I do then prepare to be disappointed . I went to the cinema with a group of die-hard league fans and we were all in agreement that this film wasn 't as funny or dark as the three series before . In my personal opinion it was a money spinner . The writing was contrived and the plot confused - no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do . It was self indulgence of the worst kind from writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticisms . I hope the league at least can be honest enough with themselves and acknowledge this film as being inferior to the superb three series . I will not be buying it despite owning most of the league memorabilia . , negative
" Let me start out by saying that I used to really like Betty Grable , particularly from " " Down Argentine Way " , " but by the time she got around to this disaster , she had also got " " round " " and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment . Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr ( who must have been fairly desperate ) the story was bad , the colours good , and the film far too long . It had some of the old standbys in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success . The music score was woeful , and I have to say not one tune was memorable in any way .... as I was such a fan of Miss Grable , I always wish I had never seen this one ! , " negative
" " " Hail The Woman " " is one of the most moving films I have ever seen in my entire life . I watched it twice in a row and sobbed my eyes out.This silent film masterpiece deserves a much wider viewing audience ; unfortunately the sole surviving print is so badly scratched that most people won 't watch it all the way through , and they will miss the gem shining underneath the rough . This film could use a digital restoration , to help bring out its beauty , but I doubt it will get it from anyone , since its main theme is Spiritual restoration before Christ of the family unit , and this is not politically correct these days . However it remains a powerful theme for those whose hearts are hurting from the pain of broken family relationships.The cast is magnificent , especially Florence Vidor , who literally glows as Judith , the daughter ; ethereal Madge Bellamy as Nan , the poor girl who gets pregnant and is cast aside ; Theodore Roberts as the crotchety old domineering father who destroys everyone around him through pride ; and handsome Lloyd Hughes , as the son David , afraid of his father , but really of life itself . This is a nice film to watch at Christmas , especially . You will not regret being patient and viewing it in its entirety despite its deterioration . , " positive
" Another French film with absurdity . Baise-Moi ( F * ck Me ) tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and f * ck . One of them is a porn star who escapes from her community after being raped and killing her boyfriend . Second one is a hooker who kills her flatmate and sees her boyfriend being shot dead . After those incidents they meet at a tube station ( both misses the last train ) then the whole thing starts . They find a bound and come very close . They abuse men sexually , take drugs , drive around the country and have lots of sex . Thats all about Baise-Moi really . We can see that they have no mercy for their victims . They even kill a woman for her money . Both actresses are real porn stars in France that affects the movie in two different ways . They look so comfortable in sex scenes , nonetheless , they can 't make the whole film worth watching as , to me , the film does not require no further ability of acting than that . It is a version of Thelma and Louise on a different level . I could recommend you loads of things to do instead of watching Baise-Moi . So , bother to watch if you wanna see a pointless , kinky film . * out of * * * * * , " negative
" As a member of the cast , I was a member of the band at all the basketball games , I would like to let the world know after being in the movie , that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon . This was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot . Seems that the U of O sign was shown . While we were shooting , we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff . Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men I have ever met . Quite a time for a young 20 year old . BUt certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60 's and early 70 's despite what Hollywood may think . Trombone player from Oregon , " negative
" I enjoy quality crapness , and this ranks up there with some of the finest. the cg is out of this world , or at least pre-dates our world , and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad . I quite enjoyed some of this , but the acting is so goddamn awful , and even the obligatory nude scene doesn 't really have any baps out in it. just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one . I don 't know who wasted more time , me watching this , or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers . I can assure you , it wont . However , on a brighter note , I have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this movie , so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it . , " negative
" The Canterville Ghost ( 1996 ) .The director made this too sappy a production . Maybe it 's the generation , but I really liked the Charles Laughton version . There is a time and place for " " emoting " " and this production does not translate very well . Patrick Stewart , reciting Shakespeare was very good , but still inappropriate . Would neither recommend nor watch again . The close-ups and padded text and sub-plots were lost on me . Adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work . The screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent , maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue . Check out the really good version and pass on this one . , " negative
" This is absolutely the best 80s cartoon ever , maybe the best cartoon of all time . It had everything action , adventure , thrill , and much more ... I can 't imagine how hard it was for Ruby-Spears company to make this great cartoon , there has been spent a lot of money for this masterpiece of work and it was worth it , for example just the beaming down scenes were hard because I wouldn 't call the 1980s for a great technology year with computers like now in the world we live in so the beaming down scenes were excellent ! The cartoons will never be the same as they were before , that is why I hope that they all will be released on DVD specially The Centurions as it 's my favorite . I have the whole complete set of 65 episodes on DVD-r but it 's not the same because if they were released on DVD the people in the world would be able to buy it and see the DVD 's in almost every store which means a lot to the fans .

That clown .... that goddamn clown .... I hate him ! I hate him so much ! And I don 't hate him because he is a good villain ... I hate him because he is annoying beyond belief !

" I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie . In fact I could not even finish it . I want my money back . One more of Hollywood 's feeble attempts to come up with a new idea . Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge . Just in case . They should of gave Nic Cage a hat and a bull-whip . Swashbucklin ' . Cage 's performance in Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas beats this " " lemon " . " People who are completely and totally marketed ( and most of them are ) should love this movie . If this film had been animated , I would have taken it more seriously . I would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it . In my opinion , this was a incredibly stupid movie and it made a even more incredibly sad attempt to try and hide that FACT.All the SHEEP seem to love it though . , " negative
" Michael Bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father ( the creepy Ray Wise ) at a sprawling , windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young , scheming and seductive stepmother from hell ( the yummy Clare Wren ) , thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family . An edgy , stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to VHS and cable TV--where I first saw it . It is beautifully written , smartly acted , and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails . I cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it . It is an undiscovered classic . , " positive
" It was a rare treat to see " " Checking Out " . " I was touched by the characters , laughed a lot at the wonderful script , and was deeply moved by the genuine emotions magnificently portrayed by this ensemble cast and especially by Peter Falk . In fact , one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children where he tells of his experience of his life , his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life going forward is so profoundly real that it is at the highest level of the best Academy Award-winning performances . He is a consummate actor who out-did himself in this film . The screenwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge , timing , a gift for dialogue and hilarious situations that had me laughing out loud in the theater . I highly recommend " " Checking Out " " to everyone wanting to enjoy quality storytelling superbly acted . , " positive

" War drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971 . It follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland--an accurate portrayal of Vietnam on American soil , before they 're shipped over . It focuses on two men--Booz ( Colin Farrell ) and Paxton ( Matthew Davis ) ... how they meet , become friends and deal with a corwardly squadron leader ( Clifton Collins Jr . ) and a borderline psycho ( Shea Wingham ) .A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher . He uses a hand-held camera throughout most of the movie and uses digital video for the combat scenes . It works very well--the film looks gritty ( as it should ) and uncomfortably realistic.Farrell successfully covers up his Irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing Southern accent . His performance is just superb--he 's an extremely talented young man . Davis , unfortunately , is not that good . He 's tall , muscular , very handsome--and very bland . The rest of the cast however is just great.This film was thrown away by its studio . It had no stars in it , a familar story and was considered " " just another war film " . " It only played a week in Boston ! It 's well worth catching on video or DVD.Also , Farrell and Davis have a lengthy nude scene . , " positive
" To keep from being bored during " " Love and Sex , " " first I tried to think of all the movies this was imitative of : " " Breaking Up " " with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek ( though that had a more original ending ) , " " About Last Night " " with Rob Lowe , and a lot of TV shows . Second was admiring just how gorgeous Framke Janssen is so I couldn 't believe for a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date . She is certainly in line to give Julia Roberts a run for her money , literally-- and wasn 't Julia in some movie with this same plot or other ? Third was trying to figure out why the writer / director bothered to give Jon Favreau 's character the Jewish name of Adam Levy ; he even refers admiringly to eating a ham sandwich.Fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review which is why I was in the theater .

" Spheeris used this documentary to push a stereotype of punks . This documentary is biased and guided , not objective . The cutting techniques that jump from interview to interview may be used to take the spoken word of interviewees out of context . When you watch the film , the sticking idea that comes from the interviews of the punks is that they are pretty dumb . Band members and other punks seem to be of low intelligence and unable to explain their motives or give detailed or coherent answers or even answers at all . I highly doubt that if some of those who were interviewed knew what Spheeris was creating or saw the final product would allow themselves to be included in the project . This film puts punks in a bad light by making them seem unintelligent and simple-minded . Spheeris ' film should not be taken as a representation of the L.A. punk scene . If you want to see a good punk documentary watch " " Another State of Mind " " featuring Youth Brigade and Social Distortion . , " negative
This first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they weren 't very funny and had a drama element where Bill ( the mother ) was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didn 't mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped . After that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the BBC have ever made ! The chemistry between Bill and Ben 's character 's were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series . The Christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas . The show came to a stop when the main actor Gary Olsen playing Bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as Up ' n ' Under and a very funny man RIPThis underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesn 't to be repeated that often - Though it does appear on UKTV Gold once in a while but it should be repeated on BBC one or two to show this brilliant Comedy to a new audience , positive
" If you 're tired by the same repetitive , unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases , you 'll enjoy " " You Are Alone " . " It is thought provoking , well shot and riveting.Without revealing anything that you don 't find out in the first few minutes of the movie , this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor . The vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come.Through their discussion , you explore two shifting views of prostitution , depression , loneliness . Yet the movie is not depressing . It talks about dark things without being depressing.As a viewer , your emotions and preconceived notions are moved around , but gently .

" The sects that capitalise on this film are well known for their claim to take the ' message ' of the bible without any alteration or extra-biblical influence . The existence of this film is solely due to the fact that there is no such thing.If you want to know what the born-again branch of Christianity were harping on about in the seventies just look up the word ' rapture ' in a dictionary of cults and sects . It 's quicker than sitting through this waste of celluloid.Poor acting , uneven sound quality and a script that could just as easily have been written by Jack T Chick ( paranoid Christian conspiracy theorist for those not familiar with the Evangelical scene ) . You could not really put this into the ' so bad it 's good ' category so its only audience are either those with a pamphlet collection looking to branch out or the extremely paranoid . , " negative
" Spoilers Well , the one line summary says it all . Melvilleì¨ˆs " " Le samurai " " is the original and there are elements of " " Leon " . " And they are better - much better ! In the " " Samurai " " Alain Delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs ( with so much suspense in these scenes ! ) . Even the end is exactly the same : the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand . The world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it.Delon is not killing so many people like the Ghost dog . But I guess Jarmusch liked " " Leon " " very much or even " " Desperado " " by Rodriguez . So he added this , too . And let me guess : the girl will become a professional like Ghost dog ( like Natalie Portman in " " Leon " " ) ? So what was Jarmusch thinking after all ? Where is the unique , the original thought in this movie ? I canì¨ˆt see the point in making carbon ( celluloid ) copies.A 4 / 10 rating by Macaulay Connor , " negative
" This was one of the highlights of ST : TNG 's semi-forgettable second season , before they ' grew up ' or grew into their own in the third season and beyond . This was not only a showcase for up-and-comers like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher , but was also the continuation of Data 's search for his ' humanity ' , this time through the concept of comedy . Still one of my favorite episodes.On a side-note , I 'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character Okona was about to have a tryst ( after Teri Hatcher 's character ) before being rudely interrupted by Lt Worf . I remember watching this episode ' first-run ' at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would 've been a perfect Jean Grey / Marvel Girl.It would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is ... , " positive
" I found this move beautiful , enjoyable , and uplifting . Initially the local sites in the film , which was filmed here in Buffalo , intrigued me .

" Oldboy ' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history.Trusting the latest Hollywood fad , vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent , asexual , love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore . This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past ... well , at least in the second half . ' Thirst ' starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story . The vampire transformation of a priest is , over quite some time , sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story , which makes for some awkward viewing . But the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory . Well , maybe not so surprisingly if you know ' Oldboy ' and ' I 'm a Cyborg but that 's OK ' , but I guess it 's fair to say that ' Thirst ' beats Park 's earlier films in terms of in-your-face violence . All in all , be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick . It may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some . ' Thirst ' is original , entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than Park Chun-wook 's earlier endeavors . , " positive
" A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects . Taylan biraderler ( taylan brothers ) had made their first shots on a tv-show a couple of years ago , as far as i know . That was kind of a Turkish X-Files , they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects . This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well . This movie will make you laugh that 's for sure , and as well it might have you scared . It has a nice plot and some young , bright actors in it . If you are a high school student in Turkey you will find so many things about you here . There are many clues in the movie about its story and ending , some you understand at the moment , some will make sense afterwords , the dialogs were written very cleverly . So these make the movie one of the best Turk movies made in the last years . Do not forget , this movie is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry . , " positive
" This is not your typical Indian film . There is some great sense of humanity , and the characters are pretty realistic . There is great dynamism in the interpersonal relationships , and there is a sense of guilt , grief , passion , passivity among the many characters . While seeing this , one gets a feel for the heavy burden of the 5000 years of layers and layers of history of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations . The final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a great footnote to such a ancient civilization , and yet , human relations are still preserved and nurtured . Saw it on DVD , the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting . Was surprised to learn that the movie has not done well ( or not being shown ) in India ( ... but maybe not too surprised ) . The artistic patrimony of rural societies is being slowly lost and its inheritance not picked up by younger generations , as some of the older musicians in the movie are no longer living today . Great film . , " positive
" As other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie ( keeping it kid friendly ) FX was low class , they should of spent the $ 1 on a coke . As is typical with these D movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead . Hope the money was worth it for Boxleitner , really really big step down from Babylon 5 . Nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers but damn this was low even for him . ' It was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also . Don 't Watch . * * * * * Warning Spoiler Below * * * * This thing chased down everyone it was after and yet Boxlietner got away ... that was pure BS . And the ending ? How in the hell did the kids end up right there with him ? That was just too much stupidity . , " negative
" I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom . I look here on IMDB , even though it is not high on the list , it is in the top 250 . I was a little surpised . Even though , yes . I am very impressed with Robin and Matt 's acting abilities , they still didn 't save the movie . I 'm not sure what I really didn 't like about the movie . Maybe it 's because I dispise math . Maybe I 'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours . Even though I loved " " American Beauty " , " but that was it . I just want my 2 hours back . It was a big waste of my time . If I 'm missing something in this movie , please E-mail me . I am curious why this is on the top 250 . And don 't say " " Because it was a good movie " . " 2 / 10 , " negative
" If you liked the Richard Chamberlain version of the Bourne Identity then you will like this too ... Aiden Quinn does this one brilliantly , you can 't help but wonder if he is really out there ... I reckon he and the other main cast members probably had nightmares for weeks after doing this movie as it 's so intense . When I first saw it I was just flicking channels on the remote late one evening .. & I got hooked within minutes. look up www.answers.com for Ilich Ramì± rez Sì°¼nchez who is the character that " " carlos the Jackal " " is based on for both ...

This has to be one of the biggest misfires ever ... the script was nice and could have ended a lot better.the actors should have played better and maybe then i would have given this movie a slightly better grade. maybe Hollywood should remake this movie with some little better actors and better director.sorry guys for disappointment but the movie is bad.If i had to re-watch it it would be like torture . I don 't want to spoil everyone 's opinion with mine so .. my advice is watch the movie first .. see if u like it and after vote ( do not vote before you watch it ! ) and by the way ... Have fun watching it ! Don 't just peek ... watch it ' till the end : ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ! ! , negative
" Ralph and Mumford , misfits in their own land , get duped into being unwitting pawns of Synanomess Botch . Twice Upon a Time is the story of them , the characters they meet , and their struggle to set things right . With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business , this offbeat movie hits the mark.The animation process , while similar to that of the cut out " " South Park " " style , is much smoother and far more three-dimensional . If I didn 't know that the animation was this style , I would swear that is was traditional pen and ink . If you can watch this film in Dolby Surround or THX , PLEASE DO ! You won 't really miss anything if you don 't , but if you do , you will get much more out of the experience ! , " positive
" If I could give it less that 1 I would . Do not bother to rent ; if someone gives you the DVD burn it.This is horrible movie making . A total waste of even digital " " film " . " I have seen better on Youtube made by 12 year old boys . Lommel claims to have written this , if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages . The story line is none existent , the dialog is mainly screaming , the camera work is some sort of attempted arty flairs with nonsensical cutting of totally unrelated jumps to either industrial transportation scenes or some sort of odd angry young woman rift.I can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a " " creative " " film - I like David Lynch.This one is either so far beyond my limited powers of comprehension I missed it or it is totally pointless . I think this is a " " lets see if we can grab a title that will be coming out soon and do a weird rift on it and see if we can grab some of the bucks " " con job.I cannot see why Lionsgate even bothered with this . Totally worthless , it is so bad I will not rent any other by this same director . , " negative
" Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and no one can play Woodroe F. Call better than he . Not only was he the first and best , he was the only person that could portray his grief and confusion . It was a bad let-down and I 'm surprised I even made myself watch it . I can even begin how how pitiful they made Woodroe . I understand he would be old by that time , but everyone knows that he would NEVER let that pull him down . The first movie was the best and the only one that I 'll ever watch . I hope to God that no more directors plan on continuing or remaking the wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval . Without them , the movies are pointless wastes of time and money for everyone , including the director . IF YOU PLAN ON MAKING ANOTHER LONESOME DOVE MOVIE OF ANY KIND , take mine and billions of others , don 't waste time . Continuing the movies is just grinding the first one into the ground . Thanks . , " negative
" I rented this movie the other day b / c I love romance stories , but this has got to be the worst one I have ever seen in my life . I find it hard to believe that Sam would fall in love with Kelley after they 've said hardly no more than 2 words to each other when she has a great long-time boyfriend who 's devoted to her completely . I thought Kelley was a major jerk throughout the movie , and he never changed at all . The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnett . I thought he did a wonderful acting job , and I 'm going to start watching more movies of his . , " negative
" Awful dreams , wild premonitions , blasphemy and homosexual fantasies permeate Paul Verhoeven 's ( arguable ) masterpiece of a true femme fatale who loves her men then kills them .

" I loved that this film recognizes the intelligence of the viewer , allowing the layers to peel from the characters through their interactions with each other about the unspoken loss that has so affected each of them . The cinematography is a beautiful , and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone I believe is an extremely talented new filmmaker with the maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to accomplish . I see a bright future for this writer / producer / director who had the ability to focus on a goal and accomplish it with integrity.Kudos for this achievement . , " positive
" What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed , creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons ( without becoming unrealistic ) , manages this beautiful movie perfectly well ( resembling in that way a little to the wonderful ' La Double Vie de Veronique ' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress ) . This is a REAL movie , that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story , masterfully directed , excellent main actors , masterful cinematography . I 've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time , and I still think it 's one of the best I 've ever seen . And if you should be unhappy with the ending of ' White ' - ' Red ' puts an happy end to the whole trilogy . , " positive
" Well , I get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that don 't reflect my experience at all . To me , Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies . He was a die-hard villain , a no-apologies villain . To me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isn 't sort of undercut in some way.The kid who played Aryan was probably over his head with this cast . There I think maybe the director could have done better . But , to be honest , the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel . She is an unsung heroine , a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered . But I must say I appreciated her contribution greatly as she played Virendra Sahi 's wife . She may be given little to do , but she does everything with total conviction . I 'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience.So if you are in a habit for settling for Bollywood average , you won 't get much out of this movie . But if you constantly search for something more , then this might give you some of what you 've been missing . , " positive
" What a great show ! A very underrated dramatic show . It is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other character ( s ) are the main character ( s ) .I think the best character on the show is Vern Schillinger . He is a tough , bad guy and an Aryan on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be . This show has many murders , I think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show , but I have to admit that is one of the reasons why I think the show is so great.I think some characters were killed off a little early , but some sure still made their mark . You can 't compare things like Prison Break to this show , they are totally different . I think some of the actors on the show are also very good and underrated and should what is due to them . A great show , my favorite 's . A show that should be considered of the the greats for years to come . , " positive
" One of Fuller 's ( a combat veteran himself ) early works of average quality , but accurately hits on the many conflicting aspects of life in postwar Germany . The main character starts the movie in Apr ' 45 as a Sgt with C Co , 157th Inf , 45th Div , which really did end the war in Munich as in the movie . ( Same unit in the previous month had fought heavily in Aschaffenburg and then liberated part of the Dachau facility ) . To the uninformed the movie may seem confusing by flip flopping between showing the good & bad of the german people . But anyone who has been there or at least well read on it would know that most of what is portrayed in the movie are things that really did happen in 45-47 Germany . The only inaccuracy I noticed was minor : while on a boat cruise of the Rhine passing the remains of the Remagen bridge he comments he crossed there . But his unit really crossed well south of there - north of Worms Germany . , " positive
" Just re-saw this movie after thirty seven years . I was eleven years old and caught this flick on South Beach at the long gone Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue . In 1969 , I thought Where it 's At ! was a very good movie . Now , however , after almost forty years , it 's not as good as it was . Times have changed , and this movie is now a tired old re-hash of the war between the generations . It did however , catch a place in time which is just a memory . It 's really interesting to see the mod fashions , the old Vegas , a slim Don Rickles , chain smoking , and a hip opening song . The acting was decent , the script somewhat out-dated , but the memories were still fresh . Where it 's At , may not be where it 's at for you , but for me , it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory lane . , " positive

" From around the time Europe began fighting World War II , until the war 's end , Hollywood ( with significant prodding from the government ) made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the Army , by making the life of a serviceman appear " " cool . " " This is by far the sloppiest , implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work , you get the best food , and you get to lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio . I am far too young to have participated in WWII , but I think that there was more to it than that . There is the barest cat 's whisker of a plot , and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day 's leading acts.I think that by 1943 , even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie . While I am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment , I can 't help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war , were amused or repulsed by this trivialization of their loved ones ' sacrifice . , " negative

" I saw Beyond Rangoon about 20 times , it was THAT GOOD . At first when I watched it , I saw the story of Laura Bowman , but later , after multiple showings , I realised that this also was a parallel documentary . It came to be in my mind , a story about Aung San Suu Kyi , and the struggles of women to remain strong in the face of uncertainty , danger , and sadness . I also would put history , and politics on the list after further viewing , since I did learn a lot about Burma 's past , and present , and could only guess at it 's future . This movie is not only one you will want to see , it 's also one you will definitely want to own a copy of . It 's a movie that could easily been seen by the whole family , although not for children under thirteen . However , the educational benefits of this movie can not , and should not be understated . , " positive
" John Wayne 's first starring role just blew me away . Televised letterbox style on AMC , I had to check and make sure I had the right date . Sure enough , this 1930 film was made using a 55 mm wide-screen process . Aside from that , it features some of the grittiest , most realistic footage of the trek west I 've seen . Wagons , men and animals are really lowered down a cliff face by rope . Trees are chopped by burly men -- and burly women -- so the train can move another 10 feet . The Indians are not the " " pretty boy " " city slickers who portrayed them later ; they 're the real deal . A river crossing in a driving rain storm is so realistic , it has to be real ( In fact , I understand that director Raoul Walsh nearly lost the entire cast during this sequence ) . I could smell the wet canvas . Each day is an agony . The various sub-plots are forgettable but the film as a whole is not . I can 't think of another title that can beat The Big Trail in evoking a sense of living history on the trail to Oregon . Bravo . , " positive

" Oh my . How can they make movies of such beauty , but that are so terribly bad . I mean , even Uwe Boll doesn 't make crap like this . There is not even a hint of a decent story , multi-layered characters , or attraction . It 's just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a ' movie ' . I suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it , given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent , that anyone older would be annoyed by it . But then again , it 's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age , that there 's probably no one that should watch this movie at all.Take my advice and stay far , far away from this movie . Your little daughter can make a better storyline , and though she probably isn 't able to draw pictures this pretty , her tales are much more worth listening to . And please , in the name of whoever you believe in , do not expose your children to this piece of * * * * . I 'll give it 2 out of 10 , and that 's exclusively for the graphics , because the story and character development are so awful they 'd deserve a negative rating.And if you decide to watch it anyways ... remember that I warned you . , " negative
" I 'd love to write a little summary of this movie 's plot , but ... there simply isn 't one ! If you just take a look at the plot keywords for this title , you pretty much know the entire content of the film : sex , breasts , exploitation , female frontal nudity and women 's prison ! 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more . " " Escape of the Island Women " " ( an alternate title that isn 't even listed here ) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial woman-in-prison classic , but it totally lacks the brutality of one . WIP-flicks are meant to blend graphic sexual images with shocking violence , but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex . Director Erwin Dietrich surely can 't compete with specialists in the field , like Jess Franco or Joe D 'Amato , and he should have sticked to making ordinary soft-core flicks . The only aspects that slightly look like cult-cinema are the resemblance of the tyrant-president with Fidel Castro and the group-rape of a ( minor ? ) girl by soldiers . The girls are ravishing , though , and the Ibiza filming location looks very enchanting . , " negative
" I really liked this movie ... it was cute . I enjoyed it , but if you didn 't , that is your fault . Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew , even though she isn 't quite like the books . The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times , but she looks good on them . To me , the rich girls didn 't have outfits that made them look rich . I mean , it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together . All of the outfits were tacky , especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits . I do not want to make the movie look bad , because it definitely wasn 't ! Just go to the theater and watch it ! ! ! You will enjoy it ! , " positive
" What an overlooked 80 's soundtrack . I imagine John Travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was 80s cheese . Clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls , bartenders and immature relationships were in style . The best was his lousy Texas accent . Compare that to Friday Night Lights.I suggest watching Cocktail and Stir Crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film . Also , as a side note Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is an awesomely bad movie . I was so shocked to realize I had never watched it . One more weird movie of this genre would have to include Cadilac Man with Robin Williams . Just remember all of these BIG stars played big roles in these CHEESY movies .. Tom Cruise , Richard Pryor , Robin Williams and John Travolta , " positive
" I saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it . Then I went home and watched it with subtitles and I loved it . I am ready to watch it again.I am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian ? The scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent mindedly forgets to be meek are my favortites.Of course the martial arts are stunning . There is really not much I can say about them if you are familiar with the HK style . However , if you are not ... we paused playback briefly and Walker , Texas Ranger was on . We noticed that after every strike there was a cut . Not in Black Mask . , " positive
" The history of the FBI , as told from the point of view of Agent Stewart via flashbacks , interwoven with his personal life story . Stewart and Miles ( as his wife ) are pretty good , as is Hamilton as an earnest agent . The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved . It 's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who 's who cast of gangsters . Some of the episodes are too long , some too short , and some just look out of place ( Stewart 's daughter 's school sequence ) . Overall , it goes on way too long . Nevertheless , it 's worth a look for its handsome production values . , " positive
" Just finished watching this movie . I couldn 't imagine watching this on VHS , as there were scenes where I needed the subtitles to hear through an accent or sound effect , even though the scene itself was in English.Visually , the movie is pretty appealing . The few CG effects were very obvious insertions , but the prosthetics / creature effects weren 't bad . Not perfect , but photography and editing ( which were pretty good ) made up for a lot . Acting was generally bad , though how much of that can be blamed on the director I couldn 't say , having never seen any of the actors before . The exception , I think , was M. Gomez ( Uxia ) . She stole every scene she had a part in , and not just because of a very pretty face , but there was something akin to an urgency to her performance that none of the others had . The writing could have been a lot better - the plot was still unmistakably Lovecraft , and plenty of Lovecraft details were written in , but I personally could have done without most of the dialogue . , " negative
" Tom Selleck plays an absentee son to senile " " pop " " Don Ameche and weary mom Anne Jackson , making up for his indiscretions ( one presumes ) and taking them in after Ameche has burned down his mobile home ; meanwhile , Selleck 's job is vanquished by the F.B.I. , his assets are frozen , his wife and kids leave him and his obnoxious sister and her brats have come to stay . Brightly-painted comedy-of-ills is as out of touch with reality as Ameche 's doddering old coot . Perhaps a serious first draft ( with scenes such as Ameche walking out into traffic with two toddlers ) was incorporated into a sillier second or third version ( with Selleck getting poked , bumped , prodded , and eventually losing a toe and a testicle ! ) . Either way , it 's a painful experience , and Selleck 's sudden dedication to his father makes little sense ; he hobbles around and howls in pain , but retains his heart of mush . This movie is mush . * from * * * * , " negative
" Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during World War I. The dialog is highly entertaining , and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as the ship 's cook , " " Ptomaine " . " Walter Huston 's character is inspiring as the captain of the submarine , a stellar example of an officer and a gentleman . One of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battle scenes . I was surprised at how similar the technology of World War I was to the technology displayed 25 years later in World War II . Basic human nature was portrayed as very similar to modern times , and far from the conservativism I thought existed in the so-called " " innocent " " past . All in all I felt that the cast , characters , action scenes , and view of history depicted in this movie were first-rate . , " positive
" I recently saw this movie in my International Business class . I was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary ( not to say I don 't love documentary I 've just hard bad luck with movies in that class ) Imagine my surprise when this movie , that 's actually a movie , came up . This film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere . The culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call . I would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh , because yes it is funny . Well , that 's about it ! Cheers , " positive
This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen . The part where they loose there daughter ? with the poltergeist overtone rip off ? just pushes it over the edge with stupidity . I watched it on showtime so it still had the cheese soft-core porn scenes in it . I have to say it made me laugh my ass off . The 80 's 3d effects were very out of place . Included an invisible cat and a spinning vortex . Wow I wonder if the people who made this actually feel accomplished in life . The actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyhow . Her screaming could be used as a torture device in hell for more than retired Nazis . Anyways thank you showtime for the super crappy horror movie . I will always enjoy the time I watched the biggest waist of time and money I have ever seen . , negative
" I enjoyed this film yet hated it because I wanted to help this guy ! I am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business ... who are now still trying to become adults .... no more fans , groupies , money etc ... and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life ... as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight ... it is almost like they have to begin anew ... this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70 's and 80 's are going through now .... and that 's where I find the film sad and depressing.BUT it portrays the life of an old rock star-abandoned and lost-in a believable way.The young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of Hollis maclaren ( Outrageous ) ... and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for . This film is a must have for folks in their 50 's who have seen the rise and fall of bands , people who knew the members , and have watched them hurt as age creeps in , and popularity fades.This is an almost perfect movie .... sad but in a way positive .... because of the whales . A MUST SEE ! , " positive
" I don 't'know ... maybe it 's because I 'm Brazilian but all that stuff was too much . Too much love for the music , too much parties , too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters ( come on , it 's not so sad ) and the aspect of the city shown by the director . Everything looks too fake to me : the families , the relationships , the music , the " " happiness " . " It simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture . I must be honest : it did seduce me a little , but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music , sex and parties ? I 'm not that stupid : what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea , profound sadness and STDs ? I liked the scene with Caridad 's mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people . , " negative

Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas . Can 't say much about this film without giving away the story .

" I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the charm , 1940 's quaintness , and good old fashioned romance and it 's hilarious , to boot ! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking \ home life articles for a famous magazine ... under the premise that she is a married homemaker . Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion . Enter a handsome GI , ( played by the talented Dennis Morgan ) just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy . His simple wish is to stay at the homey Inn the she writes so eloquently about and relax with her famous home-cooked meals . She now has to frantically find a way to save her job and reputation ... add to this that her fiancì±• is in a hurry to tie the knot doesn 't help . The humor is superb and the chemistry between the leading characters a lot of fun . Throw in the character-actor nicknamed " " Cuddles " " ( who fits this name completely ) it becomes even more adorable .

" The first episode of this new show was on today , and it was horrible . Not only did Shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture , but it 's so far away from the original concept and animation style that it 's barely recognizable as a ' Scooby-Doo ' show.Even back in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby 's nephew Scrappy was there , the team still solved mysteries . This new show instead features Shaggy and Scooby battling a James Bond type super-villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion . There 's not even a van called ' The Mystery Machine ' ( and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did NOT put my mind at ease ) . How can anyone take Scooby Doo and make THIS ? The show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole Scooby Doo gang , all of whom speak with the correct voices except Shaggy , and even then I 'm being far too generous . , " negative
" After having watched Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it , I finally had a chance to see it 's sequel Life In Transformation . I was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first . 90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie . The Philip Glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first . Compared with Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless . A watered down version of Baraka , which is the same idea but done better . I truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste . , " negative

" I remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of Disney . This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I have been looking for it . I would have to say that out of all the kids movies I saw back then , , this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once , I really hoped I would get to see it again . The story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory .

The worst , sappiest dialogue ... I could go on and on . But what really made it unwatchable was the direction . The poor actors . You can 't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action . If you check the director 's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn 't have a chance . This would not even be good as a made for TV flick . Ouch ! , " negative
" An unexpected pleasure as I had heard nothing about this film.Shameful since it warrants having a wider audience.A wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told , although admittedly predictable in its resolution . Solidly acted by the principals . Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film.My recent foray into Chinese film ( Shower , The Road Home , Not One Less ) has been an exciting one that I hope to continue exploring . China and its people is an amazing canvas for film-makers . " " The King of Masks " " can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent Chinese film . , " positive
" One of the more lucid statements against the death penalty ever filmed , quite a frontal attack against the most disgusting way of doing justice . The final sequence , with that parallel between the crimes that the convicted Poncelet committed and his own execution are just superb.No , what about the work of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon ? It leaves you breathless , they 're two giants and their performances achieve the highest levels of emotion.Tim Robbins put clear that he 's not only a good actor , he 's a nice director as well . * My rate : 9 / 10 , " positive
" This is a silly movie with much singing and dancing . Acting is average , but writing leaves something to be desired . There are rememberable performances by Buddy Epsen , with a short but outstanding performance by Gypsy Rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy . A totally unbelievable portrayal of college life which ends with a superb ice skating exibition of Alice in Wonderland . Many parts are worth watching , but do not be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie , " negative
" A country-boy Aussie-Rules player ( Mat ) goes to the city the night before an all-important AFL trial match , where he is to be picked up by his cousin . And then things go wrong.His no-hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan-shark / drug-dealer Tiny ( who looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively Australian ) . Needless to say , Mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos , and it isn 't long before thoughts of tomorrow 's match are shunted to the back of his mind as the night 's frantic events unravel.Accomplished Western Australian professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country-boy Mat , and successfully plays a part well below his age . Best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny , and an entertaining role by David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events . Roll is fast-paced , often funny , and a very worthwhile use of an hour . , " positive
" Okay , I 'll admit the casting in the film is REALLY strange--part of this is due to the plot , but I still had a bit of trouble believing Pierce Brosnan playing this lead ( though he really did a pretty good job ) .It 's based on a true story of an Englishman who went to live with the Canadian Indians in the early 20th century . He claimed to be a mixed blood Indian . He was , in fact , so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness treks--even though he was not a mixed blood Indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked ! The movie centers on this and what occurred when the hoax was uncovered.The acting and settings were great and I really liked the film ( once I suspended disbelief about Brosnan ) . It didn 't get widespread distribution--probably because it was pretty cerebral--not a Bond film nor a romance--just a really odd film about a remarkable man . , " positive
" This is probably the worst film I have ever seen . Mike Myers tries to be a dramatic actor and fails miserably . The children , who have the major roles , are almost impossible to understand and are really unpleasant characters . It was not even worth the price of the rental . , " negative
River 's edge is not a PLEASANT film to watch but it is an incredible one . Having viewed it many years ago I truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something . Perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie . Given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing . Very well acted and just UNPLEASANT at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film . Should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools . Fantastic . , positive
" I saw the preview in Femalien and thought it could be a cool film . Turns out , it is an awful garbage . There isn 't much nudity in the film , not to mention not having much sex either . There were just some dumb and corny dialogues along with some noninteresting dancing you usually expect to see during audition . In our case , you may even see it in the actual films . Conclusion : I ain 't got none for it . Just leave it alone . , " negative
" Wow . Not because of the 3-D imagery , which at times was used nicely to provide good deep imagery , but what a lame ending ! The end of the movie just seems to implode on itself . This film has got to be one of the goofiest movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it . The misogyny of this film is painful as well . If you are looking for a bad 50s sci-fi film to laugh at ( aka ' bot fodder ) , go for it . Otherwise , look for better films . , " negative
" This film played in Lexington KY for 7 days . I saw it on the last day of its run & regretted that I could not recommend it to others because this is a film that cries out for the big screen experience . The aerial shot where the crowded ship pulls away from the equally crowded dock is a masterpiece as is the scene where the two lead characters flirt on deck--almost a ballet and sexier in its suggestiveness than so many more explicit films these days . I just cringe to think that more people won 't have the opportunity to see this fine film in a theater ; the DVD experience will not be the same . Here 's an idea : if you live in a college town , see if you can lobby for it to show up in a campus film festival . , " positive
" Ho Hum . Just another flick with Steven Seagal pretending to be some spiritual being , but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing . He , of course , justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage . , How sweet . Lay the world to waste and we 'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl . Jeesh ! This time , he is partnered with Ice Cool ( Anthony ' Treach ' Criss ) . Gotta have someone to lay all those cringe-inducing lines on , man , and there are plenty . The dialog is pure crap.They go after bad guys Nick Mancuso and Kevin Tighe , two people that were born to play the scumbags.He 's squeezing Mari Morrow and impressing soap star Sarah Buxton . How cute.I guess if you gotta have some July Force excitement , this may suffice . If nothing else it will help you get your degree in Seagalology . , " negative
" If it is true that the movie only cost 150K to make , it explains a lot . But , it doesn 't explain why it has no real plot . Midway through the movie I honestly didn 't care if they made it out or not . I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed . The ending was really dumb and made me wish I would have just shut the movie off and gone to bed early . Pretty good acting considering there wasn 't much to go with . If you enjoy really bad movies with horrible lighting ( even for a cave ) and bad camera work ( even for a cave ) ... then you 'll really like this movie . By the way , if the boy 's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 years old or so , how could he have forgotten how to speak , and built up so much anger ? ? Wouldn 't he have wanted to get help from the first people he had seen even if it was 14 years later ? , " negative
" Thats not saying much . This Killjoy film has better cinematography and is more professional looking than the last . That doesn 't mean it 's more professional sounding . That horrible last film was about gangsters killing a kid and then being haunted by a voodoo clown . I thought the guy that played Killjoy in the last one was a bad actor , but wow ! ! ! This Killjoy is honestly the downright worst actor I 've seen in any movie , and I 've seen a lot of movies . Thed last movie the clown came in about 15 minutes in , this one 's shorter and the clown doesn 't even come in until 40 minutes in , and it 's only 65 minutes long ! ! ! I give it a 2 because the acting from some characters is OK . , " negative
" I really enjoy this movie . The first time it was on Turner Classic Movies . All the actors did very well but Brynner steals the show again like always ( he is so sexy ! ) .This is one of the movie that you do see Brynner 's emotions . Actually this movie this is the first I ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong , larger-than-life and serious roles in other movies . In this movie you see both a masculine , tough and sensitive side of Brynner .Brynner seems to be a " " ladies 'man " " in this movie.That is amazing how Brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian tongue it drives me crazy in love . I don 't understand when both Brynner and Kerr ( they both have very good chemistry ) stars in a movie together and then Brynner always die at the end it kind of reminds you " " The King and I " " in a way . , " positive
" I confess to have quite an uneasy feeling about ghosts movies , and while I sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror , but when it comes to comedies , they really need to be crazy to be funny . ' Over Her Dead Body ' seems to take afterlife a little bit too seriously , and fails in my opinion from almost any aspect I can think about . The story is completely unbelievable of course , and did not succeed to convince me either in the comic or in the sentimental register . The choice of the principal actresses was awful . While Paul Rudd is at least handsome and looks like a nice guy , the taste in ladies of his character seems to need serious improvement as Eva Longoria seems too aged ( sorry ) for him , and Lake Bell seems too unattractive ( sorry again ) . A romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to failure from start . Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better but they had only supporting roles . The rest is uninteresting and uninspired , with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unsuccessful TV comedies . Nothing really worth watching , nothing to remember . , " negative
" There is a lot of crap coming out of Hollywood lately.A friend , sends me movies now and again , as a surprise , it 's awesome.I turned it on and couldn 't stop watching , it is a drama , but with a odd twist . Imagine if Romeo , as in Shakepeare , had a super power . It is sad and poetic at the same time . Hollywood should take notice of the new Russian cinema , they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi . It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story , without a spectacle . This is a lot like an Asian film with a dark Russian twist . Granted it 's not perfect , but nothing ever is . You know what the power is but it is never explained , nor totally realized until the end . It becomes secondary to the emotion of the story . I don 't want to see a remake , it is too cool as is , the Hollywood system would , as usual , mess it up . Acting is top notch all around . Directing and Camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there . Kudos to all involved , and I will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic . A + + + + + If you can find i , watch it . , " positive
" I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist ( Barbara Stanwyck ) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home . The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas Holidays . Why is she worried ? Because she lives in a small New York apartment , isn 't married , and doesn 't have a baby - and can 't cook at all ! Hilarity ( and romance ) ensues when she tries to put on a believable act in an effort to save face / keep from being fired by the magazine owner ( played by Sydney Greenstreet ) . This is a delightful comedy ; one that I highly recommend to classic movie lovers ! ! ! ! , " positive

" You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , not this time . Unconditional Love has it all . Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead ... and it works . Not only does it work , it works very very well . In fact , I think it 's perfect . I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human , so honest , and so very real . But isn 't that where great comedies come from ? Don 't characters need real feelings , real emotions , and the ability to feel real pain ? Well , they do in this movie . Unconditional Love is a movie you shouldn 't miss , especially if you need a seriously good laugh , or you 're at all curious about seeing the psychotic dwarf in the red raincoat . , " positive
" Yes this movie features a gal named Jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too ( well she only causes a tree to fall once , but she does say everything is evil ) . This movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms to people , but offers little else in the way of entertainment . Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy . Of course they don 't know this until the owner of the farm 's helpers open the box containing the head . The head proceeds to hypnotize everyone it can so it can get to Jessica and use her powers to find stuff to help look for his body . This movie has an interesting enough story , but it plays out very bad here . Everyone in this flick will get on your nerves at least once . , " negative
" Before the release of George Romero 's genre-defining Night of the Living Dead , zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures . They certainly had much better table-manners in the old days . But social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie-going public ? Judging by this film , none whatsoever.The story is about an expedition to Cambodia , whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication . One of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army.This film is basically a love triangle with zombies . But seeing as this is a 30 's movie , the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh-eating variety we think of today . They seem to respond to mind-control , rather than insatiable appetites . And , quite frankly , the ' revolt ' is somewhat underwhelming too . The whole thing is really very dull . Aside from the lack of horror , there isn 't any over-the-top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained . It seems unlikely that this could 've provided much entertainment even 70 years ago . See it if you have to see everything with ' zombie ' in the title but otherwise I would advise skipping this one . , " negative
" I found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian ( Chris Rock ) who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid-50 's white mans body . He doesn 't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before . He listens to rap music , sings along , and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man . The real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community . , " positive
" We went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled . It is without doubt one of the worst movies ever . It is not that i don 't like cult-movies I do . But nothing happens in the film . One does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever. endless times without dialog . And the car . How do thay carry a huge tent and beds chairs and clothing for every day in that car ? It is a two seater ! I have to say however the scenery is beautiful , but not in a movie , the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie , so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time in with nothing happens anyway . I would not recommend it , as it is a waste of your time , " negative
" This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as what the Child 's Play movie were like , but this can get really funny and enjoyable , Chucky 's laughs are hilarious . ( SPOILERS ) Now not one doll , but two , meaning double the impact , Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child 's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection , but if you 've never seen the Child 's play movies before , this 'll will be a new start . Of course you 'll not have a clue on how Chucky got into his current state ( cause I 'm not telling you ) but you 'll figure out why Chucky is very popular.Overall a very enjoyable movie . , " positive
" I haven 't read the book of this and based on this adaptation , will not bother . I hated every character in this show - Miranda was slutty , selfish and mumbled miserably through the appalling dialogue , her sister was a total wimp , and this was the worst depiction of manic-depression I have ever seen . I have a degree in Psychology , and this was not accurate . In fact , until it was mentioned , I did not realise Troy was supposed to be bipolar - I thought he was a normal , slightly grumpy teenager.The only saving grace in this stupid show was David Tennant , whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that got me to watch the second half . Clearly the writers and producers of this show have not done any research - Troy 's mental problems are not remotely accurate , nor are the forensics involved in the " " twist " " ending ( and if you did not spot that a mile off , you are a big ole dummy ! ) Utter garbage . , " negative
" For the very reason that I love movies such as " " Central do Brasil " " ( " " Central Station " , " 1998 ) , I really love " " Chop Shop " . " There is no sugar-coating , there is no attempt to make these people 's lives over to something more palatable or pretty . What you see is what you get , and that is often gritty and at times heartbreaking . But that is exactly what makes a movie such as " " Chop Shop " " so wonderful , alongside the fact that the storyline unfolds so elegantly and subtly . For a young brother and sister , who are about as close to homelessness as one would ever want to get , working ( and living ) at an auto body repair shop in Queens , New York is as good as it gets . Is this a good or bad thing ? That is the question this movie essentially poses to the viewer . This movie is really a fantastic slice-of-life piece that at times feels like a documentary instead of a drama , and that is a great thing , because it looks and feels so real . In the midst of so , so many current movies based on essentially surreal and often implausible plots , stumbling upon " " Chop Shop " " is like finding a little gem . , " positive
" I hated this show when I was a kid . That was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents , not just the bland , generic , General American Dialect we 're used to . Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf 's was southern . Like one of the others mentioned , though , I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute . That always seemed odd to me , probably because the flute just annoyed me and I wouldn 't have gone to any trouble to take it away ! Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned : Pufnstuf ripped off McDonalds . At the height of McDonalds popularity , the TV show ( or rather , their creators ) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show , but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own . They even hired former employees of McDonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the TV shows . McDonalds sued and won . Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you 'll find plenty of articles about it . , " negative
" A badly-acted two-character comedy-drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren 't-we-awful-to-the-Indians polemic , with lousy special effects , exploitative use of nudity , and ugly violence .

" This movie got extremely silly when things started to happen . I couldn 't care less about any of the characters ; Susan Walters was so annoying , and the leading actor ( forget his name ) also got on my nerves .

" Immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago , a friend and I decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale . There was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was . To this day we still rate movies , even very bad ones , by how much better than " " The Lonely Lady " " they are.A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry , who wrote the screenplays for , among other things , " " Last Summer " " and " " Diary of a Mad Housewife , " " and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the Harold Robbins ' book " " The Lonely Lady . " " She said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didn 't think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in Hollywood . She then said " " I think they got someone else to write it . " " The interview was filmed before the movie was released . She died in 1981 , and I bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank God for saving her from involvement in the result . , " negative
" This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen . The DVD was given to me free with an order I placed online for non DVD related items.No wonder they were given away , surely no one could part with money for this drivel.How some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief , the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot on.How on earth a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable . Mostly toilet humour and badly done at that.Anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs . , " negative
" I saw this Film one midnight and I can say that it worse than other horror film about a Haunted House.Alexandra Paul is not one of the best actress but she can do the role better , The little girl get worse this is a example about a Bad actress , she has not got future in the great world of films . SENTENCE FOR HOUSE OF THE DAMNED : BAD , " negative
" Threadbare horror outing has an innocent teen ( Meg Tilly , appealing as always ) attempting to get in good with the popular clique at school ( despite the fact they seem to hate her outright ) and letting herself be subjected to their sorority-like initiation : spending the night in a creepy mausoleum . Despite the complete absence of originality , this low-budget thriller manages to come up with some decent special effects and has several good performances ( particularly by Robin Evans , oozing campy viciousness as the leader of the girls ) . The script isn 't razor sharp , but it has enough quirks to make the proceedings somewhat bearable . * * from * * * * , " negative
" Totally disgusting and cheap bawdy humor . I loved it ! ! ! It is the most disgusting and totally horribly acted film , except for Nicolas Read , who plays an un-dead Court Jester , to comic brilliance . But being that as it may , I laughed so many times and I have to hand it to the film makers , it wasn 't pretentious or ordinary in any way . Raping , fighting , zombies vomitting on their rape victims . What other movie has this ? Not for the quesy , but with a pizza , a bong , and a six pack of beer , you got it made , if you have a cast iron stomach and a juvenille sense of humor like myself . , " positive

Well , this game is great , from the news clips ( with two real persons , full of humour sense and credibility ! ) , to the story , I find it very good ! I only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die , until they disappear ; and some frustrating situations on the LEILA VR missions , when riding the bike , here and there ...

" Some have compared this film to Deliverance . I believe Of Mice and Men is more appropriate . Our leading man , Heaton , definitely loves Spike . It is irrelevant and immaterial whether that is a sexual love . It is the reason Heaton does not leave Spike . He needs him . They need each other . As brothers , as family , as their only connection to humanity . The setting , scenario , minimal cast all add up to a fine film . Frankly , I did not care what happened to the characters . But , I did care about what the film maker did with them . He did well with them . I spent some time wondering how the ending would resemble Of Mice and Men . The soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing . , " positive
To Die For has it all.This film has a great cast . Lots and lots of romance and terror . Not too gory but still enough to appeal to horror fans . There are a lot more vampire love stories . If you are a fan of vampire love stories I strongly recommend this film-10 / 10 . , positive
" This movie is just plain terrible ! ! ! ! Slow acting , slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just shouldn 't have been on there .

The characters in this movie put me to sleep almost . Avoid it ! ! ! , " negative
This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the subsiquent court case that follows . What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife.The star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along .

" I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad and happy in the same moment . I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie . But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it . The story of two friends , linked by their suffers of bodily disability , whom ( as a team ) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights . This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand , not too exaggerated but emotional presented .

" Overrated mob comedy . Director Demme makes the actors pause after some funny lines to let audience laugh , and not miss next line . Seems odd - this director did " " Silence of The Lambs " " - now there 's the way to use pauses ! Casting seems off . Mathew Modine too young for FBI agent and Pfeiffer 's love interest ! Dean Stockwell is doing a Jack Nicholson-thing with a squint , and he gets a nomination for it ! Plus we have to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians ? Charles Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a mob lawyer are underused with only one line each - they should be the bumbling hoods . Song score by Chris Isaak is totally out of place - better for a flick like " " Pretty In Pink .

" No hidden agenda . Pure scifi . All fun.I saw the original on TV and was scared pretty bad . I was a kid : ) The original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which I saw and have forgotten . The original one , starring the great movie star Steve McQueen ( BULLET ) , is by far the better and only version anyone should see.The movie production is dated , but the fx used to make the Blob stands up the test of time .

" The genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one . The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY . I realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next , but this movie was so predictable , and is just not believable . I find that the more I watch this kind of movie , the more I am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger . Continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid . If they took the time to make it more realistic , I might have enjoyed it a little . Having said that , you might be better off staying away from this one . , " negative
" This might be for those who have been to summer camps , but it sure isn 't an entertaining camp . I went to one before , but it didn 't make me scream up and down for joy . Instead , it made my head hurt.The first thing you notice is that Bill Murray actually had some hair in the 70s . Yeah , and he also didn 't mind running some . But to get him to run a lot , you would need to give him a woman to chase after.Its not that some of the stunts can 't be funny . For example the running joke with one of the councilors who is always waking up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed . Instead , its that the jokes and stunts were poorly setup and executed . It just failed to be funny.To somebody who loves comedy , this is a pain . Others are glued to it for life . I wish it was more like Leonard Part 6 , but it doesn 't come close . " " F " " , " negative
" I 've been a fan of Jim Henson and his characters since the very beginning . The most beguiling thing about them was the love and innocence and camaraderie shown . Kermit was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving . A spiritual character , yet sweetly and believably so . All the other characters were slightly eccentric but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings can co-exist in a caring manner together , respecting each other 's difference.Following movies have somewhat kept the same vibe . Yet this " " It 's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie " " would have Jim Henson spinning in his grave . These characters have been completely re-written to be horny , nasty , selfish , and cheesy.The cast goes on to portray God as an uncaring corporate head , with a mean streak . Angels as spineless , non-spiritual corporate staff , and the movie was so bad I had to stop watching . I had bought it for my great-nephew but fortunately I preview anything I give a child.This movie deserved the trash bin instead and has no socially redeeming content or charm.Shame , shame on the people who re-wrote the characters and departed from Jim Henson 's original heart-centered , socially conscious version . It does a terrible disservice to a great hearted man who is no longer around to defend his creations . , " negative
" ' The Curse of Frankenstein ' sticks faithfully to Mary Shelley 's story for one word of the title , which wouldn 't be so bad if the changes were any good at all . The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankenstein 's family has been completely excised and replaced with ... nothing . The heart and moral centre of the story is gone . It doesn 't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving , devious murderer ; he deserves everything he gets . The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clichì±•s . Even taken on its own terms , this is rubbish : a bland , rambling film featuring a shite-looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut . As it 's the first of Hammer 's horror films , directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee , its place in horror history is secure . But it 's crap . , " negative
" I tried to give this show a chance , but it really doesn 't sit well with me . Although the performances are good , the writing isn 't . The two oldest step-siblings , Derek and Casey , are equally annoying ; I get the impression that we 're supposed to side with Casey , given that she 's the protagonist , but I don 't find her at all likable . The parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless . The three younger children are the most watchable things on the show ; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet the way they team up , and Marti is adorable . The plot lines are a bit far-fetched and the whole premise is mostly hard to swallow -- blended families are common , yes , but this family isn 't really trying all that hard to blend .

Swears spill out of the speakers like a waterfall , each one getting more annoying as the last , and not contributing to the comedy OR plot ( general comedy - not this movie in general ! ) .All in all , its a lame-a $ 5 , watered-down -typed- " " Out Cold " " ish movie - But Tremendously Awful . The movie focuses around two groups of a city Poories and Richies ( how obviously dumb is that ? ) , where the two opposites have snowboard battles with each other . ( story is much like a 4-year-old 's bed time story without all the swears and stupid jokes ) MOVIE - 1 / 10 - because you can 't give any lower scores , " negative
" Return to Cabin by the Lake does not , in any way , stand up to the original . With only one main character ( Stanley ) returning for the sequal , the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time . I am a huge fan of the first film , the story line and acting was really good , but this is one movie that I will never again watch . It is basically equal to what the sequals to Urban Legends and Blair Witch were like , but with much worse acting . I 've personally seen better acting in soap operas , it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh . I , in no way , recommend this movie to anyone , watching it will just detract from the first . , " negative
" This movie gives Daniel Wu his chance to do a great action movie , but I really find Emil Chow 's character really great , gutsy but determined to righting wrongs . Plus the main terrorist , it gets me wondering his revolution , makes me wonder if he is doing this for good or bad.A movie that tells us about Todd , an amnesiac terrorist being tricked as an undercover until he learns who he really is . The consequences that he makes from his terrorist family , gives him a the choice of redemption.Purple Storm was one of the best ones that I have seen this year . The movie really stands out when it is filled with tremendous action scenes set-up by Stephen Tung Wai , which won the best action sequences in the Hong Kong Awards . ( 9 / 10 ) , " positive
Saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF . You may question some decisions of the maker - like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - but this movie sure hits you in the gut . Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch . Hope it gets the distribution it deserves . , positive
" Whether any indictment was intended must be taken into consideration . If in the year 2000 there were still rifts of feeling between Caucasian and Afro-Americans in Georgia , such as shown in this film , obviously there remains a somewhat backward mentality among a lot of people out there . It is rather hypocritical , to say the least , if everyone adores Halle Berry , Whoopie Goldberg , Beyoncì±• , Noemi Campbell , Denzel Washington , Will Smith , et. al . , whilst out in the backs there persist manifest racial divides.White grandmother suddenly gets black grand-daughter thrust upon her , only to meet up with black grandfather in a very white social backwater . The story is sweet , not lacking tragic overtones , and eminently predictable as in most of these kinds of TV films , though the final scene has you guessing ............ will he ? won 't he ....... ? Gena Rowlands in her typical style offers a sincere rendering , and Louis Gossett is a good match for her ; the little Penny Bae fortunately does not steal the show.A ' nice ' way of relaxing after Sunday lunch without having to force your mind too much , though you might just find yourself having a little siesta in the middle of it . , " negative
" This film centered on a young lady who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life . It made me think of other movies like the " " Song of Bernadette " " and " " Francis of Assisi " " and has a very strong Catholic faith influence in the film . Ann Blyth is very charming as first , the Catholic school student and then later as a young woman who buys a statue of Saint Anne ( which is the name of the street that I live on , by the way ) and makes many prayers for the saint 's intercession whenever problems come up in her life . Frances Bavier ( Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith show ) and Edmund Gwenn ( from Miracle on 34th Street ) play relatives of her . A local priest of mine used to say that my sister resembled Ann Blyth and the both of them have the same first and middle names . A nice good family film that came from an era when life was a bit more simpler . , " positive
" Disjointed , unclear , bad screenplay , poor photography and direction ... all in all very obviously an ill-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at TBN.TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring " " China Cry " , " the story of Nora Lam , to the big screen . But " " The Omega Code " " is an unfortunate miscue . As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved " " China Cry " , " I still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone . They do much good with their ministry , but this isn 't an example of it . Don 't waste your money ... go rent " " China Cry " " instead . , " negative
" OK , I would not normally watch a Farrelly brothers movie . I can 't recall ever watching one . I also don 't recall watching a Jimmy Fallon movie . Alright , I did watch taxi , but I said penance and was forgiven for that mistake . But , this movie had Drew Barrymore and I just think she is the cutest thing . I don 't know what it is about her , but I just smile the whole time I am watch her . She just captivates me that way . I mean I even watched Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates . How sad is that ? This wasn 't the greatest baseball movie - it wasn 't supposed to be . It was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for . It had a predictable ending , but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile . , " positive

" I am a youth pastor 's wife and we took some youth to see this film . We then spent an hour trying to explain it to them . They didn 't get it and I didn 't enjoy it . It is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world ( the Bible Code , the Torah Code and the Code in the Koran ) and is so questionable as to be laughable . This is not a step forward for Christians in the arts , it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door . , " negative
" James Hacker MP didn 't expect that he would be the next prime minister . Unlike in America , the party is elected in Britain while we , Americans , vote for candidates regardless of their party . Despite the differences , Paul Eddington CBE 's performance as minister turned prime minister almost overnight is helped by his senior adviser , Sir Humphrey , played by another knight , Sir Nigel Hawthorne , and veteran actor Derek Fowlds also returns to the scene as well . Now instead of pleasing some people , he has to please the nation rather than his constituency . Now , he has a hard job to do even more difficult than before . Now , he must approve the honors list and work with Her Majesty as well on a regular basis . Hacker is not the hacking type . He is rather than the every man who we like and don 't want to dislike and turn into a villain of sorts or a vicious dictator . Now , we see the prime minister 's point of view and all the pleasing that must go on as well as handle strikes . , " positive
" I am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this , but come on ! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S @ # t I have ever seen ! I ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror , but I got bored and turned it off.Let 's see : The wardrobe : Consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot . The masks were made from what looks like tin foil . The Gore : The Gore was pretty good , I must give it that . But Ittenbach 's Burning moon was better for a low budget movie . Acting : Was horrible ! I didn 't mind the dubbing . I find this humorous like in Ittenbach 's " " Premutos " " ( great movie ) . The fighting and action sequences were pi $ $ poor.Bottom line : Don 't watch any of Schnaas 's movies . There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter . Check Premutos , House of blood , Schramm and the nekromantiks . , " negative
" Ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from ? According to ' Jake Speed ' they are based on real people , living out the adventures they write about and publish . This movie is quality family entertainment , moderate amounts of violence , and skimpy clothes at the worst . The language is is also not a problem , and the jokes are funny at all levels . This is a ' Austin Powers ' look at ' Indian Jones ' , without the over-the-top antics of Michael Myers . I highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range . , " positive
" Yeah i bought camp blood and it wasted about 86 minutes of my life and 5 pounds of my money on this crap , I mean i didn 't expect an amazing movie , judging by the front cover i wasn 't really expecting anything great but at least not boobies in the first 3 seconds ( I 'm not complaining about the boobies .. ) I 'm complaining about what the hell that has to do with anything ? this film should have been kept on there hand cam at home as a joke .... they suck .. why was the blood more brown and turd like that real blood ? ... cheap i tells ya i mean everyone wasn 't in colour they were just tinted yellow , And another thing that made me die laughing at this sad excuse for a film was the fact that they tried to pretend the clown was a woman all the time , although its clearly a flat chested black short haired man ... did anyone else notice that the only special effect in this film was a slowed down jump .. that was also poor oh and the dissolve effect that you can find on many basic p.c programs such as ... powerpoint .... this film blows , " negative
" I rented this movie , but I wasn 't too sure what to expect of it . I was very glad to find that it 's about the best Brazilian movie I 've ever seen . The story is rather odd and simple , and above all , extremely original . We have Antonio , who is a young man living in Nordestina , a town in the middle of nowhere in the north east of Brazil , and who is deeply in love with Karina . The main conflict between the two is that , while Antonio loves his little town and has no wish to leave it , Karina wants to see the world and resents the place . As a prove of his love for her , he decides to go out himself and bring the world to her . He 'll put Nordestina in the map , as he says . And the way he does it is unbelievable . This is a good movie ; might be a bit stagy for some people due to its different editing job , but I think that it 's also that that improves the story . It 's just fun , and it makes you feel good . , " positive
" The Brothers Quay are directors , judging by conventional thought , should have stuck to making short films . I myself actually really liked their first feature , Institute Benjamenta , but judging by their sophomore effort , The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes , I 'm willing to agree they don 't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length . Piano Tuner is , without a doubt , a gorgeous film to look at , and often to listen to . Unfortunately , it 's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace . Reading the plot synopsis , it sounds like a pretty good story . But the Brothers fail miserably to bring it to life . One thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future : dialogue . My God , it 's awful here . A huge bust . , " negative
" * * * May Contain Spoilers * * * OK , it wasn 't exactly as good as expected in fact it was a lot different than I had thought it would be but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie.I usually don 't care too much for that type of music but in this movie it worked perfectly ( I mean duh he 's a rock star ) but anyway I loved Stuart Townsend in this , and Aaliyah , although she had a small part in the movie was amazing.And even though Tom Cruise played Lestat in the Interview with a Vampire , I have to admit that I am glad he turned down the role even though I normally hate when they use different people to play the same characters in like sequels and stuff.Overall , the movie was great and I enjoyed watching it , even if there were parts that could have been better . Great vampire movie . , " positive
" I just saw this movie last night and , being someone who had very low expectations to begin with , was still disappointed . The most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point ( the guy being awake during the surgery ) , had NOTHING to do with the outcome . It would have ended the same way regardless . So , what was the point of this ? Who knows . Also , this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didn 't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table ? Give me a break . Jessica Alba is completely talentless and Christiansen is almost as bad . The whole thing was just laughable from start to finish . I 'm fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel , you would be in more pain than that . , " negative
" That Certain Thing is the story of a gold digger ( Viola Dana ) from a tenement house . Her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers , but they are a loving family . Although Dana 's character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor , she refuses and holds out for a millionaire . Everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy , but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire , son of the owner of the popular ABC restaurant chain . The two marry hastily , but the girl 's dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger . However , she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own.A rare glimpse of movie star Viola Dana , this film is a lot of fun . Dana 's role is accessible , natural , and entertaining . She displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama.The mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too . The camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility . The title cards are also incredibly clever.If you like films like My Best Girl , It , or The Patsy , you will enjoy this film . , " positive
" When you look at Mexico 's best movies you will more than likely find that the Photography was performed by Gabriel Figueroa . He is recognized in the world as one of the best that have ever existed . His master control of the cameras gave an added asset to the movies he was part of . If added to his participation we add the direction of Luis Bunuel , you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world . This story , Nazarin , was written by Spain 's greatest writer besides Miguel de Cervantes ( Don Quijote de la Mancha ) . The story in itself is superb : Nazarin a priest that lives by his beliefs tries to live a very Christian life , but as always there are people that do not accept this . He wanders through many places preaching his Christianity but finding , most of the time , people that do not accept him . But besides the splendid story , it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that Bunuel sends us throughout the picture in scenes that make you shiver . , " positive
This was a pretty good movie that was overall done quite well . The idea about Mercy ( won 't spoil ) was original also . I think Angelina did a good job as one of her first movies . The only things I frowned upon were some of the corny fight scenes ( won 't spoil either ) . I liked the first movie and I liked this one as well . 7 / 10 , positive
" Two redeeming qualities of this film were the cinemaphotography and a storyline that was hard to resist . However , the script , the direction , and some scenes , were just awful . I kept asking myself why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie . My only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity which underlies the plot of the movie , but knew the movie was filled with flaws.This film could have been so much better , and reached a larger audience accordingly . What makes me think this is that with all of the problems of the film , some scenes being painfully bad to watch , I still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would resolve itself . , " negative
" The gates of Hell opened up and spit out this film , then closed again.Watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies I have seen , like all other movies . Nothing makes sense in this movie.It would really take too long to mention all the plot problems . In fact , except as a warning , it really isn 't worth wasting some of the nearly infinite space available on the internet writing about this film.From now on , I will check IMDb before watching any film.Hot darn , IMDb is forcing me to write more about this film . I guess I should warn you about Edison Force while I am at it . But if you had to chose between the two , pick Edison Force . , " negative
" I was never all that impressed by Night Gallery , but this one episode stands out.A TV network executive auditions an odd act - a young , nerdy boy who proceeds to make prognostications . The exec dismisses the whole thing as a flaky waste of time until both predictions come true the next morning.What first seemed a parlor act becomes a hit show as the kid 's predictions prove consistently accurate.Then , one day , he refuses to do the show . Facing imminent showtime , everyone 's at wit 's end , even threatening him with legal action if he doesn 't fulfill his contract and make his daily predictions.The young boy relents , and foretells a seemingly utopian tomorrow.After the show , the befuddled executive asks for an explanation , only to learn why the complete truth is too terrifying to reveal . , " positive
" That was a waste of 9 dollars. the movie was terrible. all the " " scary " " parts were pointless and sadly repetitive . Seemingly all of the tense parts could be completely predicted , and did not seem to hold any bit of the audiences attention . Also , the plot line didn 't advance at all during the entire movie , and it was all just a big setup for the grudge 3 . When it seemed like the movie was about to make a big plot advancement , it turned out just to be a pointless scene. these directors need to follow Hitchcock 's example : every scene has a point . Porbably 90 % of the scenes in this movie could have been left out with no change of the plot . Final opinion : Don 't waste your time , energy or money ! ! ! , " negative
" I would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes . You people are so damn sensitive it is inane ! So quick to point out the " " racism " " of the show and the jokes , yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist , pig-headed crap like " " well , duh , some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women . " " So disgusting . Abortion jokes are great because , really , who takes abortion seriously anyways ? At least I 'm not a * bore * son . I hear that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together . Talk about a movie of the year ! , " positive
... " but I laughed . A lot.I saw ' Astì±•rix et les Vikings ' at a public screening during the World Cup . The sound was lousy , it was too bright to see the screen properly - but I still enjoyed myself immensely . The names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor : Smsix , Abba , Vikea ... All not very witty , but in good Astì±•rix tradition . Some very good jokes , but also some that not everybody seemed to get.The only thing I didn 't like were the voices of Astì±•rix and Obì±•lix , in the German version at least . The voice actors are very well-known around here , which was the only reason they were casted , really . They don 't fit the characters at all.All in all , a good way to spend some time ( and if it 's free , like in my case , all the better ) and to have a couple of laughs . 8 out of 10 . , " positive
" I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible . I knew some of he facts about Caravagggio , but here they were twisted and puzzling . The images were weirdly interesting but I was looking more for a biographical and / or critical accounting of Caravaggio 's life and works , not an LSD type drug trip . The dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains , calculators , typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting . Had it been labelled an " " artsy film " " I wouldn 't have purchased the DVD ; now I have a DVD that I 'll never watch again and who would buy it ? I prefer mainstream films not those that require translation or elucidation . Thumbs down on this one for me ! , " negative
" An ultra-modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre ( and deadly ) behavior . Or at least that is what Lara Flynn Boyle 's character , Col Kennedy , argues . After a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door , Col knows something has got to give . Mark-Paul Gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect.My opinion : The House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the locations ( beautiful house ) and stylish sets . Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress , not to mention absolutely stunning . She brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing . Without her , it would have failed . " " It 's so alive " " declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house . Yes , it is alive . But the story itself is not so much.Barring Boyle 's presence , not much is happening here , as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners . The results are predictable . But I liked it anyway . The cinematography lends the film a polished look . 8 / 10 on account of Boyle , the premise of an evil ultra-modern house , the locations and cinematography , and set decoration and wardrobe . , " positive
" Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid . I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I got . My favorite one was " " The Red Sea Sharks " " - so much action and humor.This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of Herge and his development of Tintin . The film-maker 's personal experience in interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the Chan character was very moving.A great documentary of a very talented and well-loved artist . A great example of someone who has become internationally renown , and has brought joy of millions of children ( and the young at heart ) all over the world . , " positive
" Originally I rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer - and I was not disappointed that way ( except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes ) . As a dad I suppose I was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but I have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays ( as uncomfortable as I feel with the topic ) . In a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices . This dilemma is introduced by a young British-born teen girl - Jasminder ( Jess ) - of east-Indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer . The pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional Hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore ( in a nice way ) her hopes and fears for her future . The multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore Jess 's frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships . In SUMMARY , the soccer scenes are GREAT ( lots to learn in slowmo ) and while I didn 't need the storyline - something was needed to keep the movie going . , " positive
" " " Committed " " is all about Graham as an irrepressible optimist who goes in search of her self-estranged husband who has gone in search of himself which all leads to a sort of kookie , upbeat comedic odyssey involving a bunch of side characters and issues . A fresh , fun , and unpredictable little flick , what " " Committed " " lacks in story it makes up for in good naturedness and subtle morals and maxims . If you enjoy this little chick flick , which received slightly above average reviews by critics and public alike , you might want to check out Lisa Krueger 's hit Indie " " Manny & Lo " " ( 1996 ) .

" I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier . It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas.The story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville , FL , murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim 's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced.About half the footage is of the trial ; it 's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers ( two public defenders ) explaining their case , interviewing witnesses , and visiting key locations . This is edited with a minimum of needless repetition , and placed in logical order . The camera work is pretty solid . And there 's a mildly surprising epilogue . , " positive
" When I saw this animation for first time ( I was 15 maybe ) I was really impressed ! It has completely different style compared to the japan animation and i kinda like it more . Tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and dark ... The colors are not that ... colorous . The Characters don 't talk much , there are no long and boring conversations of this and that ( like in Ghost in the Shell ) .With its dark pictures , views of strange beasts and sense of magic , it looks like one of those ancient Scandinavian stories , full of violence and horrendous creators , enchanted forests and deep caves , dwelled by dragons , throlls , orks ... and one mysterious hero to stop evil ... , " positive
" When I first saw this film on video in a department store ... it intrigued me . Considering the fact that I thought I was in love and I was the same age as the youths in this film at the time ( although I realize they are now old enough to be my parents ) , plus the soundtrack being written by Elton John & Bernie Taupin just before they " " made it big " " here in North America ... I figured I had nothing to lose in buying it . I was not disappointed.So far , I have shown it to many guys I have dated since , and to my current boyfriend ... obviously , they didn 't find it as lovely as I do ... preferring to call it a " " chick " " movie ... but I still laugh and cry . This film was vastly overlooked . It 's good to see it 's available to rent at one of the local video stores around here so that other people can share the magic . So maybe it 's a bit far fetched ... but it gives you a lighthearted sense of innocence ... and a renewed faith in love . , " positive
" For a low budget project , the Film was a success . The story is interesting , and the actors were convincing . Eva Longoria , who now stars on the TV Show " " Dragnet , " " is sexier than ever . The locations were ideal for the ganster plot , and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project . Of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes , but the music keeps this script moving . Although this film has it 's share of problems , such as continuity , I must say that I would rent the director 's next movie . If your a film student , you could learn a few things from the director 's commentary . , " positive
What a horrible movie . This movie was so out of order and so hard to follow.It was so hard to follow and was just confusing . The whole time I was watching it I was wishing it would end ! ! I felt like I wasted 2hours of my life that I will never get back . Save your money and don 't rent this movie . I now see why Sarah Michelle Gellar was barely in the movie . The first movie was great but this was just sucked . I would never recommend this movie to anyone . Save your money and watch the trailer because that is about the only thing that is worth seeing with this movie . This movie had no real story to it either . I am still wondering what I watched . , negative
" Let 's get some things straight first : Zombies don 't exist so the filmmaker can have them WALK , RUN , hell even FLY if he wants to . That 's what makes this original Zombie movie so good . Everything they did was so damn original . I hate it when filmmakers do everything like Romero or when fan boys expect everything like Romero . Some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical Romero movie , once again zombies don 't exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants . The zombies in this movie all look very good but OBVIOUSLY they are not decaying corpses since they JUST freaking died ! They are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood . One of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat . It looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it . This movie got really good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue so that made me want to go see it . I 'm glad I listened . They are always right when it comes to real horror fan 's tastes . 10 out of 10 ! Go rent it ! , " positive

" Sergei Eisenstein 's most famous movie has truly withstood the test of time . The story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 does have the feeling of Soviet propaganda , but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt . The scene on the Odessa steps should remain seared into anyone 's mind.Okay , so " " The Battleship Potemkin " " wasn 't actually the first movie to use montage , but they did a great job with it here . Certainly any film history class should show this movie . It 's a great historical drama ( although I will admit that I don 't know how accurate it is ) . A 10 / 10.Oh , and we should have learned by now that " " Potemkin " " should be transliterated as " " Potyomkin " . " , " positive
" Low budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star , becomes one and then finds it all a bit too much . Good cast and a sense of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have all been here before . Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O 'Connor 's voice sounds a lot like Mini Mouse ! She disappeared from sight soon after making this movie - so life can imitated art ! A must see if you want to see a punk version of a Star Is Born though . , " positive
" The viewer who said he was disappointed seems to be wildly missing the point here . This is a superb movie , excellent and realistic portrayals of a middle class Jewish family in Brighton Beach , Brooklyn , of long ago . The nuances are perfect and I felt the casting of everyone was superior . I especially found the acting done by Judith Ivey just perfection---especially the speech she has with her daughter when the daughter comes home late one night . That scene was Oscar worthy . But , really , all the acting was fine . I recommend this movie . It is a fun , family film and delightful to see how a lovely middle class family lived in Brooklyn so long ago . See it and you will be glad you did . Has some very funny lines and the Eugene character is a real comedian--very funny . , " positive
" This movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly . Each of the three " " teenage girls " " offer their own believable , distinct , assertive and entertaining personalities . I particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between Keith and Lisa . If one looked beyond the superficial " " action " " that was taking place , Keith 's character treated Lisa 's " " deflowering " " with tenderness and consideration . The comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion . David Boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle . Dialogue was sharp , quick and flowed nicely . The director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled . Although the movie appears light on the surface , it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult , human emotions and desire . , " positive
" Mt little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs . We have seen just about EVERYTHING , especially zombie flicks . Now , we have seen a lot of good zombie movies , and a lot of bad ones . This BY FAR is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life . Not only was the acting horrible , but the special effects , graphics and ever " " zombie " " make-up was the worst I have seen . If you can even call it make-up ( black eye shadow around the eyes ) This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it 's cover . Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about. do your selves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying " " This movie sucks , don 't waste your time , return NOW " " hahahhaa I don 't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this POS movie ! i don 't even know how it got the ratings that it did , t should be in the negative , " negative
" I saw this film at Amsterdam 's International Documentary Film Festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and Tobias Schneebaum , all of whom are lively and outspoken New Yorkers . The film 's title in Amsterdam was Keep the River on Your Right , making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent . Equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship Tobias Schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist . His reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving . I can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian . , " positive
" This show is painful to watch ... It is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show , from the ever changing " " jobs " , " boyfriends , and cast . It appears that they wanted to cast Amanda Bynes in something ... but had no idea what , and came up with this crappy show . They cast her as a teen , surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings , and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy . Soon , they realize that she needs a " " clique " " and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers.How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me . Somehow , ABC has now decided that it is a " " family " " show , and thrown it into it 's afternoon lineup on ABC Family . , " negative
" A European musician and composer sets out to capture the musical diversity of Istanbul . A lover of experimenting with sound , Alexander Hacke ( of the German avantgarde band Einstì²´rzende Neubauten ) roams the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and " " magic mike " " to assemble an inspired portrait of Turkish music . His voyage leads to the discovery of a broad spectrum ranging from modern electronic , rock and hip-hop to classical " " Arabesque " . " As he wanders through this seductive world , Alex collects impressions and tracks by artists such as neo-psychedelic band Baba Zula , fusion DJs Orient Expressions , rock groups Duman and Replikas , maverick rocker Erkin Koray , Ceza ( Turkey 's answer to Public Enemy ) , breakdance performers Istanbul Style Breakers , digital dervish Mercan Dede , renowned clarinetist Selim Sesler , Canadian folk singer Brenna MacCrimmon , street performers Siyasiyabend , Kurdish singer Aynur , the " " Elvis of Arabesque " " Orhan Gencebay , and legendary divas Mì²´zeyyen Senar and Sezen Aksu . , " positive
" Viewed this GREAT Classic film of Greta Garbo and thought her performance was excellent . However , the German film version which had English captions was her greatest performance . Greta Garbo even mentioned to the press that the German film was her favorite where she had to make the change from Silent films to sound . Greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films . This story was very sad because Greta Garbo ( Anna Christie ) , " " Ninotchka " , " ' 39 , was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain . There were many scenes of Old NYC , the Brooklyn Bridge , Coney Island and the sky line of Manhattan . Charles Bickford ( Matt Burke ) , " " Days of Wine & Roses " , " ' 62 a Classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role . , " positive
" I didn 't expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend . It was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out . Still , I held out hope . It sounded a bit much like " " Bride and Prejudice " " ( L.A. guy falls for an Indian beauty , parental conflict , blah blah blah ) . B & P was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters . " " My Bollywood Bride " " had none of that . The acting seemed stilted and way to by-the-numbers . Characters were so clichì±• the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student . Technically , the sound really bothered me . It seemed as if there was a lot of over-dubbing of dialogue . I mean a lot . I know sometimes it 's necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting.Two stars is being somewhat generous . , " negative
" Man , this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books . Frankly , I found it too slow and unappealing right from the start . I kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened . This movie is vastly overrated.Shakespeare , with the King James English , has never appealed to me , anyway , so it may just be me . There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show Ronald Colman playing the role of Othello.The good points of the film include - thanks to a restored print - some decent cinematography and a young , slim and attractive Shelly Winters.Overall , this is simply too boring , too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again . Besides , we all know that most actors are nut-cases , anyway , but kudos to Hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story . , " negative
" This is without doubt the best documentary ever produced giving an accurate and epic depiction of World War 2 from the invasion of Poland in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945.Honest and to the point , this documentary presents views from both sides of the conflict giving a very human face to the war . At the same time tactics and the importance of Battles are not overlooked , much work has been put into the giving a detailed picture of the war and in particularly the high , low and turning points in the allies fortunes . Being a British produced documentary this 26 part series focus is mainly on Britain , but Russia and America 's contribution are not skimmed over this is but one such advantage of a series of such length.Another worthy mention is the score , the music and the whole feel of the documentary is one of turmoil , struggle and perseverance . Like a film this series leaves the viewer in no doubt of the hardship faced by the allies and the Germans during the war , its build to a climax at the end of every episode , which serves to layer the coarse of the second world war . After watching all 26 the viewer is left with an extensive knowledge about the war and astonished at just how much we owe to the members of the previous generation . , " positive
" I liked this movie . That 's pretty much all I can say about it . Lou Gossett did a good job , even though I 'm still very disappointed in him after all the Iron Eagle movies . And even if I was smiling on the inside when the first main teenager dies ( I won 't give it away ) it was done in a nice , fitting fashion . Pretty much everyone in this movie does a good job , so check it out ! It 's another one of those movies I found real cheap , so I bought it , and I recommend the same . , " positive
" I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot . I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value . Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out . Frequently , you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction . I could not do that with this film.I would recommend this as one of the finer films of this genre . , " positive
" One of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers , ( there were a number of such film in the 1970 's ) . This one is about an accident at a Neuclear Reactor and of the attempts to cover it up . Jack Lemmon is the employee who realizes just how dangerous the plant is and Jane Fonda is the crusading television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best.The events portrayed in the film are , of course , terrifying and not in the least bit far-fetched , ( much of what happens here happened in real life at Three Mile Island ) , and although it now looks like something a period piece it , nevertheless , highlights just how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves . Expect a number of similar films about the effects of global warming any time soon , ( and not rubbish like " " The Day After Tomorrow " " either ) . , " positive
" I thought this movie was perfect for little girls . It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most anytime they 'd like . Most little girls would like this story , even though there is the thought of death in it . Although no one dies , the king almost does , but little girls would not understand it , so it adds up to make a perfect story . All the events add up , creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough . This story is perfect for little girls , and since it is a barbie movie , the kids can have more fun with it , especially if they have barbies of their own . Anyone can have fun with it , though , because it is so cute and understandable . Overall , I think this movie is a good movie for everyone , especially little girls , and will give anyone a smile at least once during it . , " positive
" Michael Keaton has really never been a good actor ; in the Tim Burton Batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains . Here , he stars as a widowed husband that picks up radio frequencies that seems like is dead people that tries making contact with the living ... Well , this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller , but it really misses about every spot there is shocking you . Because there 's way too much stuff that ends up unexplained , undiscovered and uninteresting . So where 's the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad movie made in the first place that WHITE NOISE makes a fool out of itself ? Truly bad acting and horrifying edited , this movie is nothing to watch . Michael Keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever . , " negative
" One measurement for the greatness of a movie is , ' if it came on t.v. right now , would you want to sit there and watch it again ? ' My answer for the Grand Canyon is as powerful a " " yes " " as it would be for nearly any movie I have ever seen . There are just so many powerful moments , such an intelligent and moving story , such incredible performances . It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that were so rampant in the early nineties . But it also dramatically affirms the capacity of individuals to love , think and care . In a slight way , the movie was of its time . It partly portrays society as a balloon about to burst . Because the country was in a recession , and so void of leadership , this was true of that time . But the movie is also timeless . I think it could honestly stand up against any movie that has ever been made , and it is the most overlooked film of all time . , " positive
" Well , here we have yet another role reversal movie . There were many worth watching , despite the tired plot of gender reversal . However , this one is not . In previous reviews , I think I 've made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for Haim movies that followed the late 80s . This is one of them . ' Just One of the Girls ' is about a high school kid ( Corey Haim ) who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school . He joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader , Marie ( Nicole Eggert ) . Obviously , he can 't keep up the charade for too much longer.I thought this movie was utter crap , and it wasn 't even funny . But , judging by a majority of reviews , it looks like fans of Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen , Nicole Eggert , are the only ones who 'd want to watch this . If you 're looking for a good Haim feature ( or role switching comedy ) , look no further than 1989 . This is about the point that Haim 's career tanked . , " negative
" The movie was " " OK " . " Not bad , not good , just OK . If there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far . Sadly , Fast and Furious 2 also stunk , but I 'd rather see this than FF2 . : ) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk , this will be a " " cute " " movie for you . Personally , I 'd wait for HBO or Blockbuster . , " negative
" Not all movies are Oscar worthy but let 's face it , sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression . This one left me smiling and happy and I couldn 't wait to hug my own son . Anyone who has had a pet ( no matter what type ) knows what it feels like to lose one . I believe most people would identify with Buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth . Bruce Willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother . The little boy who played Buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend Edgar played terrific backup roles . Liked the movie a lot and it was something the whole family could enjoy . Thanks ! , " positive
i just saw Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible . The paintings in the background of the cities looked awful . Also the mob characters looked too weird . Warren Beatty didn 't do an awful job as Dick Tracy but it was definetely not one of his better performances . Madonna should just stick to singing . Glenne Headly did a good job in this movie . I gave this movie a 2 / 10 just because of the amazing acting by Al Pacino . It wasn 't a high note in his career but he still did a good job . , negative
" The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house , good effects work and sound work , a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house . There are scenes that make you jump , and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past , I found interesting . There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets , curtains and the house itself . Jerry Goldsmith 's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you . What I wish could 've happened is for something a little more intense . Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much . Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago , and it still holds up . The Haunting could 've used a few more scenes of pure terror . The ending was for me , a little anticlimactic . Overall , I enjoyed it . The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump . I just wish it scared me more . , " positive
" I watched this last night on TV ( HBO ) . I have to admit , that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other FN era movies . I loved the way Chip would be all calm one moment and then VIOLENT the very next moment . It was classic . Ahh yes . The dames , the villians , the cigars and thuggish cops ! It has it all . This movie delivered all the goods to me . I especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot , very common for this era of movie . Very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days . I rate this movie one of the best I have seen in the FN genre ! , " positive
" Down to Earth is about Lance Barton , a black comedian who gets hit by a truck . He goes to Heaven and he gets to get another body . Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington , a white guy . So Lance does a few things in the body of Charles . The movie has a few laughs , but it 's nothing special . It 's a good movie if you 're a fan of Chris Rock . Madagascar , the 2005 animated comedy , is better . This is a good movie , but Chris Rock has done way better things than this . It will only make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie . And it 's not really laugh-out-loud funny . You 'll laugh to yourself and you might giggle , but you definitely won 't be rolling on the floor laughing . , " negative
" This movie started out cringe-worthy--but it was meant to , with an overbearing mother , a witch of a rival , and a hesitant beauty queen constantly coming in second . There was some goofy overacting , and a few implausible plot points ( She comes in second in EVERY single competition ? ALL of them ? ) Unfortunately , the movie suffers horribly from it 's need to , well , be a TV movie . Rather than end at the ending of the movie , an amusing twist in which the killer is ( semi-plausibly ) revealed , the movie continues for another twenty minutes , just to make sure that justice is done . Of course , now that the killer is revealed , she suddenly undergoes a complete personality shift--her character gets completely rewritten , because the writers don 't need to keep her identity secret any more . The cheese completely sinks what otherwise could have been a passably amusing movie . , " negative
" Definitely an odd debut for Michael Madsen . Madsen plays Cecil Moe , an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him . Cecil grabs a phone book , looks up the name of a preacher , and calls him in the middle of the night . He goes to the preacher 's home and discusses his problems . The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart . That makes everything all better . Ahh ... if only everything in life were that easy . The fact that this " " film " " looks as if it was made with about $ 500 certainly doesn 't help . 1 / 10 , " negative
" People are being too hard on the film . Sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without attempting to " " review " " it.The whole thing comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his target still goes down . Then the fun begins as everyone about him also " " go down " . " Just think JFK and all the people associated in any way with his assassination , who 's lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you 'll appreciate what is implied in this film.I think it 's an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred . Though the EXACT story line my not have been followed ( hindsight here after reading Jim Maars " " Crossfire " " ) but it 's what is implied that is of interest.I 'd love to get a copy of it to view it again . In light of what is known today , The Domino Principle is right on . , " positive
" This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory . The story takes place during the same time line as the original Gundam in the year U.C. 0079 the time of the One year war , but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate . The Hero of the story is a young Lt. Shiro Amada , who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.His life get complicated when he meets Aina Sahalin a Jion ace pilot ( the enemy ) , the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them . The other cast of characters in the story are not there for background either , every one in this story has a history to them.There is also another Ace mobile suit pilot in this series that can be added into the pantheon of ace mobile suit pilots . Right up there with Char Aznable and Anavel Gato is Norris Packard , not the top villain in this series , but his presence give the 8th mobile suit team a hard fight . 3 of them against Norris and his single MS-07B Gouf custom mobile suit.In conclusion This Gundam along with Stardust Memory is a must see ! ! , " positive
" I was amazingly impressed by this movie . It contained fundamental elements of depression , grief , loneliness , despair , hope , dreams and companionship . It wasn 't merely about a genius musician who hit rock bottom but it was about a man caught up in grief trying drastically to find solace within his music . He finds a companion who comes with her own issues . Claire and Des were able to provide each other with friendship and love but more importantly a conclusion to events which had shaped their life for the worst . Des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star . Yet he has musical genius . He also has an event in his past that has made him stagnate , while things around him literally go to ruins . His focus is creating his Whale Music , in fact it becomes an obsession for him.Claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay . She finds hidden talents while being in Des company . She also finds a mutual friend that accepts her . She learns to trust him over a period of time.These two find love with one another . Not the mind blowing , sex infused kind of passion , but a love where friendship and understanding means more . For two people who have been hurt , they find trust together . , " positive
" Many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path : murder most foul , gathering of clues , gaggle of possible perps , sprinkling of red herrings , and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver . " " Forgotten " " abandons the well-trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts . The fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some , but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes , disturbs , and haunts with the question : What does an evil person look like ? Excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily ... forgotten . , " positive
" By 1955 , five years after this one was released James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films together , four of them Westerns . Their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a Universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic . Buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known - and that 's not counting Ray Teal or ' Anthony ' Curtis , later to become Tony . Perhaps ten years later the ' psychological ' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab into the mix with Cain and Abel , to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way , and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned . One to add to the DVD collection . , " positive
" Despite having a very pretty leading lady ( Rosita Arenas , one of my boy-crushes ) , the acting and the direction are examples of what NOT to do while making a movie.Placed in southern Mexico , Popoca , the Aztec Mummy ( real Aztecs , by the way , DID not made mummies ) has been waken up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in Mexico City suburbia , during the first movie ( The Aztec Mummy ) . In this second part , the leading man and woman want to find th mummy and put it in its final resting place ( a fireplace would have been my first choice ... ) Into this appears The Bat , a criminal master-mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a " " human robot " " ( some idiot inside a robot SUIT ) to control Popoca and ( get this ) take over the world . The final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious , some of the worst choreography ever witnessed . The funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious Mexican movie studio ! The acting is just as awful hearing the movie in Spanish as it is in English ( they dubbed the over-acting ! ) . You should watch this movie through MST : 3000 . The comments are even funnier . , " negative
" I loved this show . Such talent ; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled , after only just beginning . I looked forward to this show all week long . And so sorry for the people who were hoping to be The One . I would have loved to see who would have won . It just began , and in my opinion , it should not have been canceled . I hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts , and have the opportunity to reach their goals . I voted , and sat waiting for it to come on ; never knowing that it was canceled . And I could not believe that it was . I am amazed that it had low ratings ; because it was in my opinion one of the best reality shows on TV . , " positive
" In all of low budget history. this movie has to be one of the worst . True ther are some humorous sides to the movie , but in general it was just plain awful . I just can 't understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs . I mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet . The only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man . This was rather amusing . , " negative
" Thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor . David Morse is the responsible , straight-laced cop and ' good ' brother ; Viggo Mortensen , the ' bad ' boy , is a former soldier and ex-convict . As an actor ( particularly in his earliest years ) , Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performances under the Method . Turning first-time writer and director for this arty , obtuse drama , he works his script and characters out through the same methodical process , slowing the pacing down to a crawl ( ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and inflection ) . This approach might be fascinating if there were three-dimensional characters to care about , but photogenic Morse and Mortensen aren 't really convincing as siblings . Worse , we expect more from prominently-billed veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis , who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting . The picture is balky with turgid sequences , a wobbly narrative and confusing editing ( always slanted to point up the artistic excesses ) . Penn 's tricks with the camera show off a talented eye , yet they are mostly an irritation . * 1 / 2 from * * * * , " negative
" I had seen this movie when I was a boy ( Before WWII ) and was surprised that the local library had a copy . Saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was . This is an example of a movie that was not a " " A " " movie . No editing , poor script , weak acting and not much directing . Should not even be as high as a " " B " " Had a laugh at how jaded I 've become over the years . Seems to me I thought it was good when I originally saw it . , " negative
" Hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade B performance and he delivers a rather good one . Outside of Madsen and Hopper the acting is horrid ; you 've seen better at your local high school . The sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of B-movies . The scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes I 've ever seen ( it doesn 't even come close to fitting in the movie ) . The script was probably a great 10-page outline , but when it comes out to a full-length movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies Madsen left behind . I do have to say Hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the Hummer had me laughing out loud , but I don 't think that was the intent . Yes there is a little style , and Hopper can always draw my interest . However the interesting plot concept never pays off and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this . , " negative
" Despite the previous reviewer 's screed , this is a well paced and interesting documentary with lots of clips from classic 1950s sci-fi films that influenced Spielberg , Lucas and others in their more recent efforts . I agree that Spielberg 's films aren 't even in the same league as the films discussed here , such as William Cameron Menzies ' brilliant INVADERS FROM MARS , to name just one of the many titles examined , but this is still a remarkably good overview of 1950s paranoid sci-fi . Yes , it turns into a commercial for the tepid remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS during the last fifteen minutes ; you can turn that off . The rest is surprisingly good , and it 's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them , even if they can 't begin to match the originals . , " positive
" Breaking Glass is a film that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once . It is a very dark tale about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and to make as much money out of her as possible . Looking at some of today 's ' search for a star ' style TV shows on both in the UK and abroad I am always reminded of this film . Though not an expert on the subject , the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there . This film predates these shows though the effect seems the same . After getting rid of her manager , played quite brilliantly by Phil Daniels , slowly but surely the record company changes her lyrics puts her on stimulants and she is eventually totally burnt out .

" Rejseholdet ' is one of the best new danish tv-series that i have watched.The series is about the danish police force 's Unit 1 - a kinda FBI-style team that help solve murder cases all over the country , and the cases they work on , plus the influence that their jobs have on their personal lives , and the price they sometimes has to pay to be a part of a top police team.I didn 't expect much when I started watching this series - I was pleasantly surprised , the series is exciting , sometimes fun , it 's got both drama and suspense , I love it . , " positive

" This program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy I can 't get it out of my head . I find as I get older I am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done , and these four are excellent in their endeavors . Some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our PC world we 'd never be able to do it in real life . I always learn something from the shows . But if you like mystery , drama , comedy , and a little forensic work you 'll love this show . It reminds me of Quincy , ME in one way and Barney Miller in another the way they work and inter-react with each other . They screw up a lot but they get the job done , and that 's what counts . , " positive
" Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers . This film opens with incest--and purposeless , meaningless , casual incest at that .

He 's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity . , " negative
" This is one of the most hateful and cruel movies I 've seen in a long time . Sadly I was duped into sticking with it , since Donald Sutherland 's presence misleadingly gave it some credibility . [ That 's the last time that 'll happen . ] Lesley Ann Warren 's character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come . There were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film . Thats just one of many things in this movie that made me ask , " " Where is the justice ? " " Why is late-night cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological mayhem ? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women , and seem to focus on them being terrorized and murdered . This film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process . All it ends up doing is turning the viewer 's stomach with its sickness , and insulting the viewer 's intelligence.The cast is misleadingly good . My guess is that they BAGGED Sutherland first , and used him to lure the others like lemmings into this.I 'm kicking myself for wasting time , giving this piece of garbage a chance . , " negative

" After watching this movie on tv , I looked it up in the IMDB and imagine to my surprise a user rating of 7.6 ! This is not a good film .

" After seeing the TV commercials for this film I marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs . In the end it was one of the longest 90mins I have ever spent . The Wog Boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn 't fill this void.A scene where the two ' Wog Boys ' dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all . The only character that was worth watching was ' Nathan ' , played by The Castle 's Stephen Curry , his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs.A word for this flic is boring . Save yourself the time and just watch the TV commercial as the only laughs are shown on it . , " negative

Whether the story is based around a true story I feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human . On the whole this film reach into my soul and I too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity . The whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience , but I feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama . Certainly one not to be missed ! , " positive
" What an utter disappointment . Forget this abysmal film and get hold of the TV series instead . What on earth were they doing making the American president relatively sane ? ALL the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons ( Peter Cook is good as the British PM ) . It lacks the biting satire of the original , going instead for " " lowest common denominator " " slapstick . 1 out of 10 if I 'm being generous ! This is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original , the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people . , " negative
" Bad , bad , bad . How do movies like this get made ? Badly written , poorly acted ; I could go on , but why bother ? As an aside , note that the characters ' first names are the same as the actors playing them : this is a dead giveaway that no one on the set is even interested enough in their role to bother learning someone else 's characters names ! , " negative
" Long trailer ? whoever said that has got to be joking. this has got to be one of the most in depth behind the scenes or making of documentary ever made. how can it be a trailer when several minutes are spent telling the audience how the movie was conceptualized and then brought to the studios ? this documentary also spends lots and lots of time detailing how stunts were done and the new technologies created to achieve them. then it shows us how woo ping 's team came up with the fight scenes along with blocking tapes that pretty much put to shame the actual scenes with the actors. there is stuff mentioned about matrix reloaded , but there 's hardly anything really. if you are a real fan of the matrix , you have to see this documentary. the original documentary in the dvd is good , but incomplete compared to this one. for instance , it never explained why keanu wore a neck brace in the original documentary , but that is explained in Revisited. the Revisited dvd also shows carrie ann moss spraining her ankle during the lobby scene and being really distraught because she feels like she 's letting the crew down. and that 's just the tip of the iceberg. so ignore that " " just a long trailer " " review and go check it out for yourself. you won 't regret it. casual matrix fans need not apply ... , " positive
" I truly fell in love with the characters . They were very down to earth but each and every one of them had a hidden dark side . Sort of a mystery . David Graysmark , himself , was an enigma . The secret fears and just secrets in general that he had . There was a whole side of him that the other characters knew nothing about and it left the audience either wondering or assuming . There was always a part of this man that he would keep hidden away , yet he 'd share a little of himself too . He was the strong male lead character and I admire that type of character . Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who could do just about any type of part ! He 's an amazing talent and a good man . His fans love , respect , and support him endlessly.Since this show he 's gone onto many other projects and has stretched his acting ability quite a bit more and quite well . Kudos to him and all the other actors from this show for doing such an excellent job ! I wish them all well . I wish the series would 've continued on ! It 's such a shame it didn 't ! , " positive
" I first saw this movie in the night program of one of my favourite TV channels .... I was hooked from the very first minute .

" This is one of the worst movies ever made . Trite . Predictable . Flat.The only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting Barcelona . I imagine they would use films like this in Guantanamo or some other hidden CIA / NSA prison to torture suspects.Often bad movies have some redeeming features , this has nothing . If I was in it or worked on it , I would change my name . Truly a turd . Hard to write more than this , but I feel the world 's film watchers needed a head 's up on this . On the other hand it will make a great gift for people you can 't stand.You could send it to politicians you dislike , in laws , ex-wives , Teachers you hated , former employees , Dick Cheney , W. , and a host of others . , " negative
" It seems that all companies that are enjoy with the taxes taken by Romania for picture , grant the image that disappear since 1994 .They are hardly try to get the oldest car the had founded , but they never take pictures of the Lamorghini , Ferrari , Aston Martin and all new Mercedes that are more the you can find in some important countries.A second problem is that they filmed in some neighborhoods in Bucharest where they had the possibility of clear the streets and put garbages on dressing people with i don 't know maybe ' 90 clothes a making them seem so stupid that you will realize the script was maybe a second hand bought from ebay or worth.I wist for future to keep making movies in US and to make good money there than to give us a little bit and shame our country.I have no reason to believe that someone will understand the message ( beyond my English--- : sorry ) , " negative
" This film probably would have been good , if they didn 't use CGI ( computer generated imagery ) for the werewolf scenes.It made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonish.CGI is great for certain effects like the dinasours in Jurassic Park or Twister.But when we see a film where the creature must look completely real , CGI is not the way to go.Look at An American Werewolf in London.No CGI.Just makeup and a mechanical creature and what you come up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel.This film did offer a few gags that was fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have drawn me in but it 's nothing more than a film that I thought was O.K.And that 's not good enough.In my opinion , An American Werewolf in Paris doesn 't hold up to the original . , " negative
" I remember catching this film on a C4 screening a year ago and I was completely blown away by the whole thing . I thought the film managed to represent such a diversity of genres ; the supernatural , a love story , the intrigue of crime , and so many more.I was hooked on the whole thing after a minute or so and was really concerned about the characters . It made me feel terrified at one second for Jimmy , and then had me laughing away at the gangsters in the next ... and all the time I had my fingers crossed that things would work out for Jimbo ! Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are superb , Bryan Brown is absolute quality and had me creasing up , along with David Field , who was funny as well as being an evil git.Since I saw this film I managed to order it on DVD and as a result , every person I show it to has been hooked in much the same way.This film is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy evening , and it 's one that you can really appreciate with your mates around . , " positive
" I love so much about this movie : the music , the cinematography , the acting , the story , and all the Mormon clichì±•s . Just because they are clichì±•s doesn 't mean they aren 't true ! This is not perfect , it is a movie after all . Though excommunications are held in well-lit rooms with nice big desks and chairs , it was totally appropriate to portray it as the dark , cold scene they did in this film . I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop , smoking a cigarette . I thought that was so cool . I mean , I believe that angels do watch over us . What is one supposed to do while waiting ? Smoking is a way some people pass the time while waiting . I loved the irony cause Mormons make such a deal about smoking . I saw this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake , and cried every time ! It blows me away . And I 've watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time . I would jump at the chance to see it again on a big screen . I hope the Tower Theatre in Salt Lake will bring it back regularly at General Conference time , as a cult movie ( pun intended , but no offense intended ) . , " positive

" Yeah , I guess this movie is kinda dull compared to some of Pam Grier 's other films . The plot is overly familiar , the dialog stilted , and some of the acting isn 't too good . But it 's worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film , where we see Ms Grier in a sexy blue wetsuit , with the zipper half unzipped . Yeah , it seems like a frivolous point when discussing an actress of Pam Grier 's talent , but she also happens to be an extremely gorgeous woman , and back in the day , she had a body that wouldn 't quit . It 's nice to see it being showcased in a tight wetsuit . Rent the DVD , and then tell me I 'm wrong . Can 't , can you ? That 's because you know I 'm right ! : - ) And yes , I really did give a 10 just for the wetsuit scenes ! ; - ) , " positive
. " . . or type on a computer keyboard , they 'd probably give this eponymous film a rating of " " 10 . " " After all , no elephants are shown being killed during the movie ; it is not even implied that any are hurt . To the contrary , the master of ELEPHANT WALK , John Wiley ( Peter Finch ) , complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms--no matter how menacing--without a permit from the government ( and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability ) . Furthermore , the elements conspire--in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic--to leave the Wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the Elephant People ( as the natives dub them ) to close the story . If you happen to see the current release EARTH , you 'll detect the Elephant People are faring less well today . , " positive
" I found this movie quite by accident , but am happy that I did . Kenneth Branagh 's performance came close to stealing this movie from Helena Bonham Carter , but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie . This movie brought to mind the excellent movies that Branagh made with Emma Thompson . Carter 's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as I have seen from a female lead in a long time . Portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off , but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life , she made it so believable . If this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women " " uglying " " themselves up for roles ( Charlize Theron , Halle Berry ) , I fell sure Carter would have had strong consideration for an Oscar . If you run across this movie on cable late at night as I did , trust me , it is worth the lost sleep . , " positive
" think of the most un-film-worthy subject you can and this is 10 times worse . A woman needs to complete as many crosswords as she can in a day . We don 't even get to see the questions and think of the words on our own , we just watch her struggle . The woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do the crosswords , but for some reason she spends the time distractedly walking all around the city when she could be focused at home . The acting is horrible , the actress huffs and puffs as she tried to think of the words , and we are left completely in the dark . The New York scenery is nice but the movie relies on it too much and it gets old fast . The movie plays like a rejected NYU student film . This film has no redeeming qualities and I do not recommend it to anyone , ever . , " negative
" " " Nurse Betty " " is the kind of movie you can 't describe on a poster or in a trailer or commericial . It 's the kind of movie that you walk in to expecting a more mature " " Dumb and Dumber " " what with temporarily insane waitress goes on a cross country adventure while avoiding crooks trying to kill her.The fact is , this film is a wonderful , heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams . The best part about " " Nurse Betty " " is it 's unpredictability . Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality , and along with the touching drama , and hilarious comedy , you can never tell what is going to happen next . , " positive
" I watched this mini in the early eighties . Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor . In fact when he began Law and Order I was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role . Unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills . I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it . It is both factual and entertaining . Everyone should see it to know what really happened . I was so moved I purchased and read the book " " Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds " . " And saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight . If you get a chance be sure to watch this movie and see what a performance Mr. Waterston can really provide an audience . Enjoy the movies ! , " positive
" From the beginning of the show Carmen was there . She was one of the best characters . Why did they get rid of her ? ! The show not the same as before . Its way worse.The best episodes were with Carmen in them . You can 't replace someone from the beginning ! That is like South Park without Kyle or Child 's Play without Chucky ! It 's not right ! The niece who replaced her is just , ugh ! Awful . She doesn 't fit into the storyline at all . She was one of the main characters , and the niece can 't replace her . She was an awesome actress . Way better than the niece . Get her back , or you 'll lose a TON of viewers . , " positive
" One would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role , to be a funny movie . This is not the case here .

This is one you can watch when it comes to TV , don 't spend any other money renting it . , " negative
" Why did the histories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so dour ? Divorced women with indifferent daughters . And why very little reference to the original show and characters ? The daughter characters were silly and uninteresting . Why can 't there ever be daughters who like their mother 's on TV ? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis , and Rhoda would return to NYC , but why couldn 't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars ? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters . It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course , but it could have been better , much better . Well , there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion , a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion , hopefully Mary will do better next time if she revisits her old Mary Richards stomping grounds again . , " negative

" The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa . I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process . Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness . We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past . What 's happening in South Africa should guide us all . I found it credible , moving and at times upsetting . There were no outstanding acting performances but this added to the strength of the narrative . Once again the BBC has been instrumental in taking a complex topic and turning out a top class movie . , " positive
" This picture started out with good intentions , Bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility , and Shue is cute as usual in her role . It all falls apart after that , it 's your typical Hollywood thriller now , filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore , minus any kind of humour , wit or soul . In other words , don 't waste your time watching this . Get the audiocassette tape with John DeLancie as the Invisible Man instead , also starring Leonard Nimoy . Now that was good , and HG Wells is well served , unlike with this mess . , " negative
" Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures . It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people , living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world . Generally , a good movie . It entertained , provoked thought , and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise , right in our own back yard . Should be seen by all . Having lived in the U.S. all my life , I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn 't know they were citizens . This movie helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state . The obvious conclusion : If this is really for real , then what else is out there that we know nothing of ? , " positive
" If any movie ever made Italians look bad , this is it.Duke Mitchell - what an A--HOLE . Duke Mitchell , I s--t on your grave . Seeing as practically every person gunned down in this film by the cowardly Mimi is either black or of some other racial or ethnic minority , it 's hard not to become convinced that the guy ultimately owes his allegiance to the Ku Klux Klan or skinheads . Awww , but he doesn 't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence , so that means he can 't be all bad , right ? WRONG . Typical softheaded sentimental tripe.While I do understand why some people might be struck by and even , to a certain extent , admire the film 's audacious , totally un-PC verve ( it 's certainly unashamed of its own hatefulness and sense of self-involvement ) , but this doesn 't change the fact that the main character , Mimi ( and , by extension , Duke Mitchell ) , is thoroughly loathsome human being who earns not one iota of empathy or interest , especially given that Duke Mitchell is such a COMPLETE BORE as a performer . But what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to fame ( apart from this dog t--d of a movie ) was being a second rate Dean Martin imitator ? , " negative
" This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the " " Night Gallery " " show back in 1971 . The episode starred Sue Lyon ( of Lolita movie fame ) and Joseph Campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire , respectively . The vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child ( which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster ) while he goes out at night for blood . The baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire 's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror , has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult , and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child . She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally . She bolts out the door , the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over . I don 't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes . They should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one . A total wasted effort . , " negative
" If you played " " Spider-Man " " on the PS version , then you 've seen it all . To truly experience it you should get the DC version . Simply put it 's a much graphically superior game ; the textures are sharp , levels are easy to navigate , and it has much better sound then it 's PS cousin . I bought this game back in late ' 00s and it still holds up even till this day . Well , Marvel : Ultimate Alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you 're a fan of ' ol Web Head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library . Swinging around the city as Spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game . If you have a Dreamcast , snag this up for cheap . The DC version is simply incredible . , " positive

" Lord , this sucked . There 's a particular sort of sexual revolution flick from the 60s that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation . This film is an example . I lost track of how many times women are slapped , hit , whipped , or spanked in the film . And then there are all the times that women in the film fantasize about being slapped , hit , whipped or spanked ( you know they want it , right ? ) . Sometimes it is ostensibly part of safe fetish play-acting . Other times it plainly isn 't , but you will wait in vain to see the heroine report to authorities that she has just been raped . Instead we get to hear her being lectured by her rapist about her inability to " " let go " . " Every scene of this film reeks of misogyny ( speaking as a straight , white , married man in his late 30 's , not a teenage lesbian women 's studies major with a chip on her shoulder , lest you get the wrong idea ) .Perhaps the one good thing about this film is that it provides a stark reminder of just how bad things really were for women only a few short decades ago . , " negative
" I happened to have seen this movie this morning on TCM . Very bad acting , low budget and poor plot are the impressions I felt while watching the movie . The only highlight of the movie was watching tender young Rita Moreno , ( 23 years old ) , playing a teenage Indian squaw in love with an older man in his 50 's . She reminded me of a earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita ( 1962 ) , only a more innocent Lolita . She bounces up and down like a 1950 's teeny bopper , almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum , falling all over this old man , willing to give him anything , as he plays it off like she 's a hindrance to him . Any man in his 50 's that had a beautiful , virgin , teenage girl willing to do ANYTHING for him and be his bride , would be insane not to take advantage of her . It 's too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didn 't permit more of an expansion of a character such as Rita Moreno 's . The only reason why I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is Rita Moreno 's appearance in the movie . , " negative
" Headlines warn us of the current campaign to demonize drug users , note the nostalgia for Mussolini in Italy and remind us of our wont to profile likely terrorists . " " Focus " " reminds us of the evils of rampant fear and distrust and the anti-Semitism disguised as pro-Americanism of the WWII era . What goes around ... Lawrence Newman ( William C. Macy ) becomes the unfortunate victim of hate crimes after he is mistaken for a Jew and these attacks increase when his bride , Gerty ( Laura Dern ) highlights the look . Newman rails against the false accusations when they cause him direct harm but he minds his own business . We see the rise in anti-Semitic attacks through his myopia , a condition not completely cured by eyeglasses.Macy 's typical everyman role is featured again and the long road to realization that we are all connected nearly costs him his life . What is it about the character Macy portrays to us ? We can 't choose to ignore the violence , hate , and bigotry because citizenship forces us to take sides . Newman 's dilemma is that he has no alternative but to side with the mistreated and goes through hell to see it . And our sadness is that most of us need to be beaten up to realize the dangers surrounding us.Let 's focus . , " positive
If you like really shocking movies this is for you . The acting is the worst I 've ever seen and the story line goes no-where .

" This movie is another one on my List of Movies Not To Bother With . Saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent , stayed up late to do so , was very annoyed to find that it was about 95 % romance , 4 % everything else , 1 % history if that . It 's what I call a bait and switch movie , one with an interesting title , the actual movie is a scam . This is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment , this movie is almost an insult to those who served . The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes , they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France . And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunter 's character . Flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls , an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn 't have lasted two days , it would have either been the stockade or the infantry . Discipline in the French Army was often rather fierce . In short , another Hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment . , " negative
" Firstly , the title has no relevance whatsoever to the movie . It started off fine with good development but got annoying when he couldn 't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him . Even his attempt to tell the police failed , which just added to the annoyance value . There were too many pregnant pauses in the movie that seemed more like filler than anything worthwhile . The plot never revealed who did this crime to him although a good plot would have allowed disclosure . The ending was nothing short of " " hey we 've run out of budget let 's stop it here NOW ! !

" Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film . It 's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance . It is a simple movie told very well . The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores ... If you haven 't seen this movie yet , you must check it out . The cast is all terrific . I wish they had never made sequel after sequel . The first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel . It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie . She hasn 't seemed to age ( she 's just as gorgeous today , without the hairdo and seventies clothes ) . The scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever ! , " positive

" This movie is a total dog . I found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so I wouldn 't feel like I 'd totally wasted my money--and my time . The writing in this film is absolutely terrible . It 's a shame it 's not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies.They should have saved the money on getting D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right . Even Gary Coleman wasn 't properly utilized for his role.This movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots . After viewing this movie , I 'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of Napolean Dynamite-like humor , where it 's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery . Unfortunately , this movie fails to deliver the lines , the characters , the delivery or the humor . I should have gone to the dentist instead ! , " negative
" With several name actors ( Lance Henrikson , David Warner , Joe Don Baker ) , why was Jeffery Combs given the lead ? Henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead , as would Warner , Baker or even others in the movie such as Charles Napier . Combs was miscast in this , and did a poor job of it . Everything he did seemed fake or contrived.The script is poor . Meaning that if Lance Henrikson ( or another ) had the lead role , he might have saved the film ( removed it from my " " waste of time " " category ) , but it still would have been a bad movie . The screen play was completely lacking . The director should have recognized this and helped the movie along . , " negative
" The title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence , but it is not good at all . One 15 minute sequence with Jack Black beautifully playing one of his songs and tripping on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all . Every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things , except for the main girls I could not think of one movie where I had seen them before . I hate to bash movies but I also hate not being able to find something decent in movies . The film is sad , not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast . If it were redone and written over it could be awesome . If you want a good movie to see stoned , watch Grandma 's Boy , or Half Baked or Dazed and Confused , but this is not a movie to be seen at all . , " negative
" For the most part , " " Michael " " is a disaster í˜¯ ten minutes of charm and ninety 's worth of missteps.Travolta and MacDowell do their best , frequently rising above Nora Ephron 's numbingly banal script . But the film moves like a snail . And even within its fantasy context , the characters behave implausibly on a regular basis . ( Reporters who routinely let the story of a lifetime í˜¯ an apparent angel living on Earth í˜¯ out of their sight ? ) Someone forgot to tell romantic comedy maestro Ephron that William Hurt , brilliant in so many other films , is no Tom Hanks . The movie 's " " climax " " redefines the word contrived . Ephron may be shooting for Heaven here , but unfortunately " " Michael " " is a long , long ride through cinema heck . , " negative
" A stunning film of high quality.Apparently based on true events which , as told , has the clear ring of truth about it , this movie is highly emotional and deeply moving.An abused and neglected child often becomes wayward in adulthood , as one of life 's failures , be it as a gangster , drug addict or burden on society.Antwone Fisher as a young adult in the navy , is troubled . He is on the brink of being a loser . He is counselled in therapy by a psychiatrist and it is that relationship which takes center stage in the play.In flash-backs and therapy the source and remedies to Antwones angst are revealed.Outstanding performances from the whole cast . The story is in effect a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment . All the actors give full blooded performances with conviction and realism.One message from the movie is the importance of raising children decently.The real Antwone deserves success . To have endured wickedness as a child but to rise above that , shows a magnificent character.And to all those out there who have endured such torment but to have survived and succeeded : you are all winners . 10 out of 10 . , " positive
" I loved it , having been a fan of the original series , I have always wondered what the back story would be - it didn 't fail to delight me . I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz I didn 't recognise one person - this is refreshing , much like BSG . It has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - can 't wait for the series to start airing . Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job . The special effects , dialogue and acting were all spot on , and I felt emotionally tied up in the storyline . I know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment , but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most of the Sci-Fi stuff produced in the last decade . , " positive

Yes , the character is identified with his persona , but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest . His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz.There is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means . Cruise 's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor . Do see the 1997 original Amenabar Open Your Eyes ! , " negative
" I got this one a few weeks ago and love it ! It 's modern , light but filled with true complexities of life . It questions and answers , just like other Eytan Fox movies . This is my favorite , along with Jossi & Jagger . This pictures a lot more , universally , than only the bubbles we may live in . You don 't need to be Jewish or homosexual to enjoy this - I 'm not , but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies . At first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further . Relationships we have to live with are superficial , meaningful , deep , fatal , you name it . You don 't know what 's coming , and you definitely don 't know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time . It is worth seeing several times . Fox movies include great bonus material - here a great music video and " " the making of " " ( including explanation of the title , interviewing Lior Ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and Arabs with doubts about the Israeli life styles ) . , " positive
" Lame , lame , lame ! ! ! A 90-minute cringe-fest that 's 89 minutes too long . A setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility ( an abandoned convent ) is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky , witless dialogue that 's straining oh-so-hard to be hip . Mostly it 's just embarrassing , and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat ( a sample of this movie 's dialogue : after demonstrating her artillery , fast dolly shot to a closeup of Barbeau 's vigilante characterí˜šshe : ' any questions ? ' hyuck hyuck hyuck ) . Bad acting , idiotic , homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects , it looks like the director 's watched ' The Evil Dead ' way too many times . I owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they 'll never get back . What a turd . , " negative
" John Garfield plays a Marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on Guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability . He has all the stereotypical notions about blindness , and is sure he 'll be a burden to everyone . The hospital staff and his fellow wounded Marines can 't get through to him . Neither can his girl back home played by Eleanor Parker . He 's stubborn and blinded by his own fears , self pity , and prejudices . It 's a complex role that Garfield carries off memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama . The best scenes are on Guadalcanal , where he 's in a machine gun nest trying to fend off the advancing Japanese soldiers in a hellish looking night time battle , and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a train platform with a white cane , dark glasses , and holding out a tin cup , all the while his girlfriend walks backward away from the camera . , " positive
" This is your typical junk comedy.There are almost no laughs . No genuine moments . No memorable lines . No scenes where you think to yourself , " " that was clever " . " Nothing . The plot is embarrassingly bad . It 's ugly to look at and boring as hell ! There is no substance here . This movie has nothing . It doesn 't matter if Farely was in this or not . A crap movie is a crap movie no matter who 's involved . Also , David Spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same lousy character in ever movie / TV show that he 's in.This movie was dead on arrival . There is no life here . No fun . No intelligence . There are plenty of other " " dumb " " comedies more enjoyable that this one . This film is just pathetic . 2 / 10 , " negative
" I thought this movie did a down right good job . It wasn 't as creative or original as the first , but who was expecting it to be . It was a whole lotta fun. the more i think about it the more i like it , and when it comes out on DVD I 'm going to pay the money for it very proudly , every last cent . Sharon Stone is great , she always is , even if her movie is horrible ( Catwoman ) , but this movie isn 't , this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime , and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs . Don 't wait for it to be a classic , watch it now and enjoy it . Don 't expect a masterpiece , or something thats gripping and soul touching , just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs.All in all , this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven 't seen it see it , because what the critics and box office say doesn 't always count , see it for yourself , you never know , you might just enjoy it . I tip my hat to this movie8 / 10 , " positive
