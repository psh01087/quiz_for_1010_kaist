" Chris Nolan 's labyrinth like noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish . A first film is as complex as " " Memento " " or " " The Prestige " , " though maybe a little harder to get a handle on . Still it smacks of originality and creative drive , and has a " " twist " " as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp . Few film makers have made as good of use of their editors and attention to narrative that Nolan has . The story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street , until he follows someone , whose noticed him following others , and has been following him in tern , from there the complexity escalates and identities begin to rearrange . More naturalistic and realist than Nolan 's later work but just as razor sharp . , " positive
" I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting . I never had to read this book ( thankfully ) , or it would have been a painful experience . I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn 't worth my time , or my friend 's . I think this story is not worth telling . It 's like saying that old people have a past before they got old ( no kidding ) . The lives of the main characters were painful to watch , one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes . However , I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story . I 've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn . I 'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given , which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try . , " negative
" When this movie first came out back in 1984 , Prince was one of the hottest acts around . Everyone wanted to see this movie , which was not much more than a extended music video . The acting was pretty bad , but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time ? Despite that , it was still a very entertaining film ! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some all time classic comedy , especially their rendition of " " The Password " , " which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their " " who 's on first " " baseball routine.Appolina ( who went by a single name then ) provided some beautiful breasts , so you had the brief nudity covered . Plus , she is very attractive . And of course , the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded . Prince later on had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name , but at this particular time in his career , he was at the top of his game.This movie doesn 't rank in the all time great category , but it is pretty entertaining . , " positive
" First of all , I wasn 't sure who this film was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn 't understand and find boring . There wasn 't really much to it , Bruce Willis wasn 't stretched as an actor at all . He did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his - unless you are a big fan of his I wouldn 't bother . And if it 's the story you 're interested in ( guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child ) , I would go to see About A Boy . It has everything this film lacked , humor , sadness and reality . , " negative
" I can 't tell you all how much I love this movie . I have read reviews that say that this move is " " too confusing " " or " " like swimming in drying concrete " . " I say that these reviewers have no imagination ! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction , this movie is for you . If you ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you , ( especially if you got into the Oriental Adventures ) I 'm just sorry that I did not get to see this movie on the big screen . ( Just more incentive to get my own big screen t.v. : - ) , " positive
" " " The Buddy Holly Story " " shows the famous singer 's beginnings in the dunk Lubbock , Texas , to his rise to stardom , to his tragic death in a plane crash . Strengthened by the fact that Gary Busey , as Holly , plays his own instruments , this movie is the biopic in its purest form . There are some things that seem a little hackneyed , namely the people of Lubbock considering rock ' n ' roll to be the devil 's music , but the masterful performances outweigh any weaknesses . If there 's only one thing that 's for certain in this great big world of ours , it 's that Buddy Holly 's music will never get stale . Whether it 's " " That 'll Be the Day " , " " " Peggy Sue " , " or another one of his songs , they still sound great after all these years . He remains one of the greatest singers in history.Just to show what Lubbock really thought of their most famous son , they didn 't name a street after him until 37 years after his death ! What a bunch of ingrates ! , " positive
" Another in the they don 't make em like that category . This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean , sometimes over-the-top fun . Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the troubled Hadley siblings , and they really took the roles and ran with them . Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories , both honors being eminently well-deserved . They counterbalance the somewhat bland leads . Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors , but they 've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here . It 's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here , but that 's more of a personal bias than anything else . But that doesn 't take away from the movie 's overall entertainment value , which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable . If you 're up some night and this movie comes on I 'd say watch it . It 's well worth it . , " positive
" This was a surprisingly very good movie , and an interesting idea .. However , it was just a little bit disappointing in that the ' Twist ' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie . Whilst watching , it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that , the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist , but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow . There were superb performances , there was never a dull boring moment , so totally well worth watching this one . It kept me interested right up until the end , and for me there isn 't many movies that can do that these days . I highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie . , " positive
Bland ' is probably the word I 'd use to try and start describing this film . I only watched it because it had a good rating on here and i was SO let down.Basically the film is about racism in a post 9 / 11 America and the director went at it with a sledge hammer ! There was no subtlety in the film at all and it felt as though they were trying to achieve a kind of Magnolia feel to the film - which is never a good idea as that film was three hours of tedium and confusion only for it to start raining frogs at the end ... All in all a HUGE disappointment . , negative
" The biggest and most disconcerting things of the Raptor movie was ending for the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult . The similarities to the Carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line . The only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep . Then the plot went down hill from there . Would have been nice if a different plot had been devised , rather then cloning the earlier movies . The raptor movie should have taken lesson from Jurasic park series in various plots . The only movie that has come close to a good dinosaur movie most recently is Aztec Rex . The repeated scenes as if taken from the Carnosaur movies leaves a person thinking of those movies . , " negative
" An RKO Short Subject.A group of rowdy little bullies are given a lesson in tolerance by crooner Frank Sinatra , who compares America to THE HOUSE I LIVE IN.This little film delivers a pertinent message about the evils of prejudice & bias . Sinatra is an absolute natural in front of the camera ; intense & sincere , he is the perfect spokesperson for the values espoused here.Sinatra sings 혩The House I Live In , ' by Lewis Allan & Earl Robinson . This fine tune , with a solid , pro-American message , is being given something of a comeback since the horrendous events of September 11 , 2001.After Pearl Harbor , Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis . Not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service , but the output of the Studios was largely turned to the war effort . The newsreels , of course , brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week . The features showcased battle stories or war related themes . Even the short subjects & cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda , the boosting of morale or information dissemination . Together , Uncle Sam , the American People & Hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination . , " positive
" A recent viewing of THAT 'S ENTERTAINMENT has given me the urge to watch many of the classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifties . ANCHORS AWEIGH is certainly a lesser film than ON THE TOWN . The songs aren 't as good , nor is the chemistry between the characters . But the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites , such as Tchaikovsky . And the scene at the Hollywood Bowl , with Sinatra and Kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top , and then running down the steps , while dozens of pianists play on the piano , is the best scene in the film , even though the scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse is more famous . Classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing . Sinatra then croons , " " I Fall in Love Too Easily , " " before having his epiphany about whom he loves . The color is beautiful , Hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution-free air ( Can you imagine Hollywood in the twenties , let alone the mid-1940s ? ! ) , and the piano music is absolutely glorious . MGM certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these . , " positive
" I think the film is educational . However , it fails to treat the issue which sparked so much controversy : plural marriage . Also , the film fails to reveal what the LDS church espouses . Big opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually believe . I could not get a clear idea of what it is LDS views are on central topics of religion.I have many LDS friends and they are nice people . Would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they view their prophet 's more controversial statements . Maybe these statements are just too controversial to be treated in a film format , but it would have been great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith 's truly interesting life . After all , it gives insight into American thought on religion in the 18th century . Hope they do some documentaries on this fascinating subject , allowing historians to comment on Smith 's life . We may have a Mormon president some day . After all , Smith ran for president . , " positive
" This movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together . I wouldn 't call it a movie , it 's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished , illogical stories , which are not all that funny . There 're several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning , and they just disappeared from the story . He 's just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1 / 2 hours . I left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy.I think this movie is just an extended version of " " Hitch " , " padded with a lot more characters and dancing.If this is the best movie that this couple has ever made , then I 'm pretty sure I 'm not interested in any of his previous ones . , " negative
" For us , an Abbott and Costello movie is something you have to be in the mood for . I 'm very happy I recorded this -- my wife remembered it from when she was young , but I had never seen it . The family wanted to watch something not too serious before bed and this was selected.Our daughter has watched many of the old movies with us -- always complaining in the beginning , but most often coming around . She mostly ignored this in the beginning , preferring to check her email , but she started enjoying herself -- many times laughing out loud to the zaniness.It 's wonderful to think you can have a fun evening with a 55yr old . The mono-colour introduction that blends into the full-colour fairy tale . It 's a fun twist of a story that everyone is familiar with , that includes a little song and a little dance , along with everything you expect Lou and Bud to delivery.Watch it with your children and have a very fun evening ! , " positive
" This was without a doubt the worst movie I have ever sat through . And that 's saying alot , because I 've seen my share of horrible movies.But I have never seen a movie in which every single character portrayed was an unintelligent loser . Seriously , there was not one respectable character in the entire script . How fitting that the plot was equally lame , lacking any intelligence whatsoever.I can 't believe that Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz would even consent to participating in such stupidity . And while I haven 't seen all of their other movies , I 've always enjoyed their performances until now . It 's not that the acting was bad , just the entire story line was moronic . , " negative
" A clever overall story / location for a story . Action is respectable . The children are annoying and their motivation is unclear . The leading villain was a nice change but could have been better . " " I Love You " " was more overplayed than " " you complete me " " but at least Van Damme got a chance to show a little tenderness . One of Van Damme 's better movies . , " negative
" A tour deforce ! OK the kid that plays Oliver is a bit toooooo sweet ! Starting with the great cinematography , color , costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie . I have seen several adaptations of this great novel , but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot ! It is a masterful Fagan , never leaving his character to do a song . You never really know if you like him or not , the same feeling I got in the book . In other versions you hate him from start to finish . Bill Sykes .... when you read the book hes a mean one , and so he is in this movie . Oliver Reed was masterful . His wife directed this masterpiece . I went and saw his last movie , Gladiator based on his many fine performances , not to see the headliners . The music fits the times and the mood . Who will buy this beautiful movie ? You Should ! , " positive
" For all of the hype about this film , I kept an open mind as to what I would ultimately think . And , although a bit slow at times , the first 90 % of the movie is quite good , with more than a few " " old time " " scares that make one jumpy and unsettled . I actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes . Where Dark Remains fails , however , is in its climax . The ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be MILES APART from its body . The storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and , the answer I was seeking most - what REALLY happened to Emma ? - was not elucidated upon ! The rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best , and in the end , I felt very cheated . What could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending . , " negative
" I wanted to see Valentine ever since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever . When I watched Valentine , I was amazed at how great the story line actually was . It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all . The actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning . Some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor , and I admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring , but overall it was non-stop entertaining and suspenseful . It had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn 't deserve all the crap it gets . I recommend this movie to watch anytime , but especially on Valentine 's Day because it 's sure to give you a ton of chills . Oh , and don 't even pay attention to the trailer OR rating , please , DON 'T ... , " positive
" Slaughter High the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history . Unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell . A very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness . The guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released . If you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember , choose life . , " negative
" Jack Frost 2 is out of the question , I 'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies.As Sam and his wife take to the Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas , Jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with inbreeding ... Don 't take a swip at this film at all , most people say its a laugh with your mates , but frankily its a waste of time . If the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do , they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story , especially the cheesy character names . , " negative
" Chan is in New York and he gets involved with an attempt to sabotage a new aircraft design.The war was over a year away from reaching America but the second world war was already raging everywhere else in the world and so it colored everything since most people probably realized that war was coming . Here the War isn 't mentioned but the fact that the film deals with the production of planes at the very least alludes to it . The mystery itself is pretty good , it the notion of plane sabotage lends itself nicely to a couple of rather tense moments . To be certain we are talking about Charlie Chan so we can be certain that he would live to fight another day , but there was no guarantee what condition he would be in , not whether anyone around him would survive.I really like this film a great deal . Its not one of the nest , and far from the worst . It is one of the truly rare things , a truly enjoyable one . Definitely worth a look or six . , " positive

" This film , had it been done properly , has SO much potential . Parody films are always funny , and people tend to like them because they 're light hearted , stupid and silly but fun . This film WAS funny in some parts , but it could have been a lot funnier . The acting itself was OK from all the actors , but ... I wasn 't satisfied . It seemed a tad empty , and my summary title says it all about the effects . Proper green screens weren 't used for this movie ... backgrounds were added in after which just looked terrible . No wonder this film went straight to DVD lol . It wasn 't ALL a total loss , it is funny and will give you a good laugh ( AT it , not WITH it most of the time ) . , " negative
" How many more of those fake " " slice of life " " movies need to be made ? Hopefully not too many.Raising Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood . Nothing wrong with that in general . What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich챕 in the book of supposedly " " edgy " " Hollywood independent production.It 's supposed to be " " real " " so left shake the camera " " documentary style " , " except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose ... It 's " " edgy " " so let 's not waste any time lighting the film.It 's " " hip " , " so let 's have the children use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface ... And so on , and so forth . All that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing Hollywood that won 't impress anyone outside of the " " rarefied " " indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film . , " negative
" As I am always looking for something new and unique , I watched this film online . I thought that it would be just another " " B " " rate movie but I was amazed at the acting by the two main characters . All of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed . The plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story.This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp , " " Dumb and Dumber " " or blood and guts . This is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting.I would prefer this movie to many " " A " " rate movies I have seen even a great number with high box office earnings.I highly recommend this movie . , " positive
" The choice to make this SNL skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones . The humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor , and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or two.Oddly enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided , but that may have been because the constraints of live television schooled me to not expect it . I suppose I was thinking more " " Leisure Suit Larry " " risqu챕 than the producers were ... Definitely not a PG-13 movie , which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors , but still better premise and writing than its more dismal ones.I liked it , but I doubt it will be a smash hit ... ( which is sad , as Tim Meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other SNL alumni tend to ) , " positive
This movie was really bad . I mean really really bad . The scenes were like from a parody and special effect sucked a lot . And it was filmed in 2003 ! ! ! i think this was a great waste of time and money and Michael Shanks with his ' Shaggy from Scooby Doo ' image just made me laugh . Never waste your time with this picture ... I really don 't know what the director was thinking after seeing the final cut of this movie but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to look on them . The ' latex cat women ' fighters were like sheep just rolling around the scenes and looking frightened around like they had no clue what to do on the scene ... I think this is a beautiful example of Bottom 100 picture . , negative
" Cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating ( except for the dragon prop ) . Now just how did the long-gone studio known for Chuck Norris movies ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place ? Case in point : the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution . They actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundreds of lusty bimbos , just to make this look even better . For the two " " Barbarian Brothers " , " they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land . This is the single greatest waste of potential I 've seen from an " " expensive " " low-budget movie , and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print without mercy . All of this followed an advertising campaign that sold T-shirts based on THE BARBARIANS ! The movie alone makes a great souvenir ! , " negative
" Never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations .

Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world . However , Eglantine missed her final exams to becoming an accomplished witch . Mr. Emerlius Browne , ( David Tomlinson ) was the person who sold Eglantine this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution .

" Blind Date ( Columbia Pictures , 1934 ) , was a decent film , but I have a few issues with this film . First of all , I don 't fault the actors in this film at all , but more or less , I have a problem with the script . Also , I understand that this film was made in the 1930 's and people were looking to escape reality , but the script made Ann Sothern 's character look weak . She kept going back and forth between suitors and I felt as though she should have stayed with Paul Kelly 's character in the end . He truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle Neil Hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time . Paul Kelly 's character , although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved Kitty ( Ann Sothern ) as opposed to Neil Hamilton , while he did like her a lot , I didn 't see the depth of love that he had for her character . The production values were great , but the script could have used a little work . , " negative

Finally found it yesterday 2 / 13 / 02 on Lifetime Movie Channel.Jim Larson 's comments about it being a " " sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths " " were dead on . Writers probably shouldn 't get a bonus , everyone else SRO for making the movie.Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT.Natasha 's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric , to say nothing of her beauty , that anything she is in goes on my favorite list . Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for.God Bless her , her family and future endeavors.This movie doesn 't seem to available in DVD or video yet , but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would too . , " positive

However , for political reasons , the present government wants to forget this old fight . Without having any possession or money , but a valuable gamecock , they struggle to survival with the expectation of the acknowledgement letter from the government , recognizing the law and paying for the delayed pension .

" One of those movies where you take bets on who will die first and who will survive at the end . There was just something about the movie that made me zone out . I think because I keep looking back and thinking " " yep still in that tree ... still looking at the water " . " Poor character development . I felt nothing when they were in danger . I was voting for the croc . I found it hard to believe a croc would try to tip a boat in the first place and then when it jumps into the boat I find that really unlikely as well . The croc seems too supernatural at times ( ' all knowing all seeing ' ) . Also when the croc attacks it 's behavior seems very unrealistic . It 's a killing machine and wouldn 't be letting victims escape twice to three times in a row , especially when attacking in the water . , " negative
" This has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century . It is all the way low quality , but at the end it falls below ... everything . All the cheap tricks - like flashing and darkness - are used to hide those crappy computer effects.All the actors are below average , especially the main character Anne Fletcher ( Simmone Mackinnon ) . There is a scene , where Anne is asked : " " Why you seem so careless ? " " The correct answer is , because she can 't act . No matter what happens ( the world is about to be destroyed , her friend is dying , she is fired ) , she has the same stupid grin in her face.It is not only the movie , which is B -quality . It is also the back cover description ( at least in Finland ) . The text mentions things like Lorica Gray -vessel , Capital -vessel and main character Garrison Harper and Anna ( not Anne ) Fletcher . The description sounds like a different movie , both featuring character called Fletcher and sea monsters , " negative

Basically , I wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens , any UFO 's , anything at all suggested by the title of the movie , the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie ! I was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was . This could have been used to the movie 's advantage , but I felt , instead , that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me ! Finally , how big was this cast 's wardrobe ! ?

" The early films of the Dead End Kids ( before they were re-christened " " the Bowery Boys " " ) were all very entertaining and well-produced films from Warner Brothers . Despite their being rather formulaic , they still had excellent writing , acting and hold up well over time . Do NOT confuse these with the cheap Bowery Boys films from Monogram Pictures--despite the presence of Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey , these films were several notches below the earlier films in regard to quality.The film begins with tough-guy John Garfield winning the lightweight boxing championship . Unfortunately , shortly after this he 's on a drunken binge and is blamed for a murder he really didn 't commit . The problem is that he was so loaded that he wasn 't sure he didn 't kill the man , so he runs away and lives the life of a hobo . Eventually , he meets up with feisty May Robson and the Dead End Kids--as well as a lady you just know will become his girlfriend given time.Where the rest of the film goes was not all that surprising , but because of the quality of the film , it doesn 't seem to matter . Garfield and the Kids are at their best and this is a film sure to please all but the pickiest of viewers . , " positive
" The photography on the DVD is so dark I thought the screen had died . I think I missed seeing half of the movie . Still , it was poorly crafted and not interesting . I did not find the story related to the title " " The Black Widow " . " I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller but did not get involved enough to care after the first few frames . I rented the movie especially for Willem Dafoe and was sad it wasted his talent . I do not believe Giada Colagrande has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture . She is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie . Although they are married in real life , they lack chemistry on the screen . Their relationships did not seem believable . I do not understand why the other characters were even introduced into the plot . , " negative
" I also joined IMDB for the sole purpose of commenting on this film , but so that I can sing its praises . I had never heard of this movie ( it 's packaged so horribly that it 's easy to see why it may get passed over ) but a good friend suggested it to me and I 'm so glad she did . It 's a gem of a film . The actors are great ( Kathy Bates and Meredith Eaton in particular ) and look like they are truly having a fun time .

Great cast led by Rod Steiger carries the film along and leads to a surprise ending . Well directed & shot - a really nice movie . , " positive
" This movie was amazing . Never before have I seen such a film that brought me to the harsh reality of drug use quite like this one . There is no glamorizing , sugar coating , or glorifying heroine . This movie shows the true struggles , pain , and loss people go through when dealing with this drug . Good film , decent emotionally packed acting , and a great storyline . A much watch ! , " positive
" " " Hari om " " is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name ( played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding ) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India . There 's no " " Bend it like Beckham " " backdrops and stereotypes , and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood ( however , the soundtrack is well worth procuring ) , but rather , the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors . Fortunately for us , Hari Om 's companion is a young and beautiful French woman in search of a journey . With overtures of an " " Y Tu Mama Tambien " " trip toward self-discovery ( without the sex and fatal disease ) , this beautiful film calms and brings the philosophic mind . Against the initial juxtaposition of the protagonists , all identify with traits of both and the cultural divide disappears as humanity steps in . Most succinctly put , the movie 's central theme , " " Everyone has a love story , don 't let yours pass by " " teaches us a great deal about love on a number of levels . Don 't let this film pass you by ! , " positive
" If you like The Three Stooges you 'll undoubtedly like this 17 minute short . There were certainly some amusing moments in it , but like all the Stooges ' work , this revolves around their particular style of slapstick comedy , and I have to confess that somehow the Stooges just never really did it for me . Their slapstick always seemed angry rather than funny , and even though it was obviously fake , their antics always seemed more likely to cause hurt rather than to cause laughter . In this short , the slapstick revolves around the attempts to find Shemp ( who is a Professor of Music in this ) a wife , because he 's just inherited half a million dollars on condition that he marry within 48 hours of the will being read . One of his students is interested , but once word of the inheritance gets out , there 's suddenly a long line-up of potential brides , and a pretty good cat fight emerges between them . Fans of the Stooges will enjoy . For me , it has all the elements that drive me nuts about them . 4 / 10 , " negative
" I saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release , in a justifiably empty theater . Believe it or not , after decades of watching movies , this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time ; or at least the worst that I would allow myself to watch.The acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of drunken high-school students yanked off the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less.After the first shock of disbelief , we laughed for a while as each scene hit new lows . But after a while , even that dubious pleasure wore off and it just got to be really sad . , " negative
" Jesus Christ , I can 't believe I 've wasted my time watching this movie . I only watched because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd . But watching this film almost put me off her . This is absolutely awful ! I could have been watching Survivor Series 93 over this.The lead guy in this was so bland and generic . I would love it if the great Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove ' 91'd his ass through a glass window . I was enraging every time he was saying " " lake " " and " " cabin " . " I 'd kick his ass.Jordan Ladd , on the other hand , was absolutely wonderful . A true angel . But she couldn 't even save this utter joke of a film . Sadly , she couldn 't even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug . It looked hilarious.I also loved the bit where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her . It reminded me of a time where ... nevermind.Anayways , do watch this film because of it 's awfulness . , " negative
" Poorly cast , terrible script full of holes , hot blonde gets eaten alive , The evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache , one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor , terrible special effects , they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster ... Awesome . The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings . Haha . Good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners . I highly enjoyed this movie , but before you watch it make sure you 're in for a good laugh . I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious . I can not , in my right mind , think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously . However , if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy , I really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed . Very simply . So get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie . It brought some joy into my life . , " positive
" The second in director Cohen 's trilogy of Second World War comedies ( the others being 혩Till Death Do Us Part ' and ' Adolf Hitler - My Part In His Downfall ' ) is a film version of the BBC 's long running ( and much loved ) situation comedy . Like most transfers of television shows , this movie suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches . Some of which work better than others for example the scene where a high ranking army officer floats down a river is a memorable , surreal moment.The joy of this movie is it 's representation of a past that probably never existed and an England which is defined by picturesque countryside and the chance it offers to see veteran scene-stealers such as John Le Mesurier given their biggest film roles . Arthur Lowe is superb as Captain Mainwaring , a bungler , who , when the chips are down , displays great courage and saves the day ( the climax is probably the character 's greatest moment ) .Episodes of the television series are of course funnier but as an introduction to a British legend , you cannot find anything better . , " positive
" Well , I can safely say I 'm human , Wong . And I didn 't throw up . I laughed . And laughed . If this movie made you puke , there is something wrong with you . But this movie is incredible . I bought it four days ago , and have watched it 5 times already . The animal cruelty gets my heart , but not long enough to be guilty . The movie is shocking , disgusting , and vulgar . The acting is horrific . What else do you want from a movie ? I am a die-hard cult film maniac . Pink Flamingos is awesome . It makes Rocky Horror , as someone has said , look like the teletubbies . , " positive
" Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal , you saw in-jokes all over the place . If you know anything about porn , this mock documentary will leave you cold . Everything in it rings false.Spinal Tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top . This film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real world.The acting here is uniformly awful , but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good . But it 's not . , " negative
" Distasteful , cliched thriller has young couple doing cross-country research on America 's most infamous murder sites , becoming road partners with a dim-witted young woman and her snarling boyfriend--who is an actual psycho . Arty and alienating , the film 's tone alternates between pouty pseudo-irony and silly flamboyance . Handsomely-made perhaps , but ultimately laughable . Brad Pitt 's performance as the low-rent killer is godawful . * from * * * * , " negative
" I was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world . A hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and extended family of companion workers created a person able to succeed in the world . For the most part the Hispanic culture is shown as I have always observed and admired - hardworking , optimistic , and truly family oriented . The points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the Catholic church . Without a doubt , the actress who played the mother deserves an Academy Award . Her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears . I will recommend this stunningly thoughtful film to my friends and family . , " positive

" " " Closet Land " " tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements . You could read lots of stuff about the movie 's plot before hand , but you don 't really need to . All you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation . Along the way , we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated . We also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place . Especially when you have absolutely no control over it.In the end , the movie amounts to a warning ( really though , the movie has several different aspects to it ) about what happens to people 's freedoms when they " " look the other way " " and ignore injustices happening to those around them.If you 've got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this , I strongly recommend that you do so . , " positive
" I participate in a Filmmaker 's Symposium , and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so great film and participated in a 40 minute discussion .

" Terrible film made on a budget of about $ 9.99 . Very obvious miniature sets used , poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship . The film contains some blood ( not enough to disturb ) and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands . ( Yes you read that correctly . ) One saving grace was a song performed at the " " talent show " " ( how 's that for irony ? ) by a punk / new wave band that I think was called " " I 'm A Heat Seeking Missile " . " Other than that , this is not worth your time , not even on a " " so bad it 's good " " level . Watch if you are into cheesy alien films , but anyone else should steer clear . Rating : 1 out of 10 , " negative
" Aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat , this film rings true on the chaos of the post-war.Beautiful photography , and a powerful national expression of the Polish national character.It 's very slow at points , but its entire pacing is so different from American and Western European films that it 's quite refreshing.Both lead actors do a very good job . On the DVD version , you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew , and the lead actress Stanislawa Celinska has gained about 50 lbs and lost all of her beauty . But in 1970 , she was a stunner . , " positive
" the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant ! i love it ! all the story lines are so good ! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real , and it really drew you into the show. the show is basically about this family called ' the Days ' and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day ( mum ) , Jack Day ( dad ) , Natalie Day ( sporty daughter ) , Cooper Day ( outsider son ) , and Nathan Day ( boy genius son ) . each episodes a day of their life , with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things it could 've continued with , I 'm really sad another season wasn 't made. it was a great show I 'm gonna miss it . , " positive
" I don 't give much credence to AIDS conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized . In the early years of the AIDS epidemic , the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies . This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of San Francisco . The city , renowned for its beauty , has rarely appeared uglier than in this film . A sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene.While the acting and plot can 't be said to be well-done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss . Actually , I found the most interesting performance to be Irit Levi as a crusty and cynical Jewish , lesbian ( ? ) police detective . She 's interesting , though not necessarily convincing.Highlights : the film 's use of the garishly tragic Turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist , Ron Athey . , " negative
" I have read the whole ' A wrinkle in time ' book and then saw the movie . The movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting.A wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg , Charles Wallace , and Calvin must team together to find Meg 's father and get off the island Camazotz . The beginning of the film is really a stinker . The acting is awful , the direction is laughable , and so far the situations aren 't necessary . I really was crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle that wrote the book and created the movie , made a great book , and a terrible film . The acting is worse than any straight-to-video acting . Yes , I got to admit there was cool effects . But seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible . If you read the book you will be crushed by the movie . I wish could give it a 0 but sadly I can only give it 1 . A half could have been useful . , " negative
" Anyone can make a movie these days . Budget , production value , or experienced crew don 't have to stop the self described " " director " " from " " realizing their dream " " these days.Respect for the craft of film-making , or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film.Director Bill Cowell must have thought he struck gold when Lion 's Gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with.I personally find Lion 's Gate far , far more in error than Cowell in regard to Dark Harvest 2 being made available to the public . Lion 's Gate 's deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney general 's office and Lion 's Gate 's officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film , film-making , and good sense.As for the film itself , it 's not even worth commenting on . , " negative
" The Derek 's have over the 1980s produced a few decent bids to acquire the title " " worst movie of all time " , " and this is probably their prime achievement in these stakes . In fact , this film can be regarded as belonging to the " " so bad , it 's good " " category , right up there with the products of the likes of Edward Wood Jr. or Doris Wishman . This explains the IMDb voting pattern for this film with some people handing out top marks.Anthony Quinn made the odd dodgy film in his time , but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad , it has to be seen to be believed . , " negative
" This is a student film and it 's a piece of crap . I would use much stronger language to describe it but then the review wouldn 't be posted and the world needs to know- beyond any possible reasonable doubt- this movie REALLY SUCKS.There seems to be a different ruler used when measuring an already famous director 's early work . Like somehow it was genius that we were just too stupid to comprehend since he finally got it right now today . I 'm not buying it . The early movie " " Bad taste " " made by the LOTR Peter Jackson 's sucks and this " " early work " " from another famous director really sucks the same way too . These " " early works " " are representative of crappy everything , from budget to scripts to actors etc .. it all is bottom of the bucket trash . Don 't be fooled by the big name.If you like watching a handful of male 70 's hippie burnouts pretend they could ever command a ship with the worst special effects you have ever seen- this is your movie.I can 't f * 37449ing believe this thing won a golden scroll award for best special effects .

" I can 't add much to what has been said already , except I 'm going to have to because of the 10 lines minimum policy.I 've actually got this on a VHS-to-DVD copy , but the quality is quite poor and I desperately need for it to be officially released.I can just imagine what extras I would like to see ( Tim Healy 's character swearing his way through one of those ' Football Bloopers ' type programmes would be great ! ) . You can imagine it now , can 't you ? But of course , it looks like most people will have to carry on dreaming about a DVD release.Surely to God there must be someone in the DVD releases department at ITV who also knows something about British culture , is web savvy and has enough about them to look at IMDb now and again ?

Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen . Pathetic in almost every way.I threw the DVD straight in the bin - I didn 't even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift shop.The effects are beyond a joke .

The water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds - nothing works.Then there is the limp plot - about as much depth as a Scooby Doo cartoon.I couldn 't wait for them all to drown . , negative
" This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film-there is hardly any dialogue in it , apart from the narration ; and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly . I didn 't at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend ( who also has red hair ! ) It is almost an old fashioned type of children 's films , saying that children nowadays prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story etc-but I feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does . Maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages -not just children . , " positive

" After a very disappointing Part 3 , I kinda wondered if I should even bother with The Next Karate Kid , while I could see why this saga wouldn 't continue , I still enjoyed The Next Karate Kid most out of the second and the third Karate Kid movies . While there are some very unrealistic moments and situations , it was very enjoyable and the story is a catchy and warm one.Hilary Swank , has this girl come far or what ? She plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents to a car accident and when Miaugi sort of " " babysits " " her per say , he notices that she has karate skills . He offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life . Now of course there is the boy that likes her and the mean bullies that are pretty similar to the first Karate Kid , but I would recommend this one .

" At least with the teenage geek gets the girl films , the guy is usually unpopular with girls . In the 40 Year Old Virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin . But then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did I miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years ? One of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them . I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent TV comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs . They 've done the gross out movies . They 've done the let 's act like all Americans have a mental age of 15 . Where will they go next ? This film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it . , " negative
" The animation is great , I 'll concede to that . But Disney perpetuated every stereotype we Alaskans have been trying to overcome for the last two generations . And the names , I mean , come on ... Sitka , Kenai , Tanana & Denahi ( cheesy takeoff of Denali ) ? ! Those are real places where real people live ! And the real people these real places were named for are probably struggling out of the Earth seeking vengeance over this trite little flick . Disney , you 're based out of California & Florida , right amidst the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country . If you can 't stick to what you know , at least hire and / or work with people who know what area you 're trying to caricuture . Maybe then it wouldn 't be so insulting ! : ( , " negative
" The biggest problem with this film is that it 's nothing like Bruce Allmighty . The first film played upon every daydreamer 's fantasy of being able to control ones surroundings as one sees fit . Evan 's experience though is entirely different . He has none of the control that Jim Carrey fools around with and instead the story centers around the power of belief . Now this would have been fine , since the first film was preaching the same message . The problem is that the sequel does it 's preaching at the expense of the comic relief . And to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into the plot . You get the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film , and it 's main objective is not to make you laugh . To sum things up this movie is failed mixture of Eddie Murhphy 's " " The Distinguished Gentleman " " and Charlton Heston 's " " The Ten Commandments " . " I 'm not sure if Steve Carrell is at fault here , you get a sense that it 's his character that limits his abilities as a comedian , the former news anchor Evan Baxter is not supposed to be funny , he 's basically an antagonist made into a protagonist which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movies message is supposed to be about . , " negative
" " " Radiofreccia " " is still a good surprise in Italian cinema . The film is based on a book of Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue , who also directs the movie and writes the music score -of course.The film is a portrait of north Italian province life , in the Emilia Romagna region . We 're in 1975 , the time of the first free radios -one of the boys of the movie creates " " Radioraptus " . " Youth wishes , friendship , love , sex , individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes , but the film speaks also about drugs -Freccia , the main character , is a victim of heroin slavery.Without being boring and moralist , the story flows very well ; the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well . Obviously Luciano " " Liga " " Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a movie professional , first of all he 's a musician . But he succeeds in making a good product . Unfortunately he 'll not repeat the success with his second movie " " Da zero a dieci " " -not good at all.In " " Radiofreccia " " actors are generally not very famous , the only star is Stefano Accorsi -one of the most popular young Italian actors . See in a small role another Italian songwriter -Francesco Guccini , he 's the nice communist barman and football trainer ! , " positive
" I 'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum , and many of the reviews . I think Tony Scott made a good movie here . Yes , it is highly stylized , flashy and over the top , but it is very entertaining . I 'm glad at least Ebert and Roeper agrees with me : ) This movie may not be for anyone , but if you like over-the-top , dark humor , cool action and dialog , you should see it . I 've previously seen Scott 's Man on Fire , Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all good movies , but I like this one more . It 's like a roller-coaster ride , with great soundtrack selections , visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13 , it is nice to see that someone isn 't afraid of showing nudity , gory violence , and have explicit dialog.It doesn 't hurt that Keira is super-hot , and even shows nipples in this one , either ... , " positive

" The ultimate gritty heist film . Elements of Bogie , Welles & Sinatra will leave you sweating & satisfied . In comparison , it really upsets the proverbial apple cart to see recent films , such as " " Oceans Eleven ( remake ) " , " reviewed in such high regard-especially in Europe .

There are frames in this film that could be Renoir paintings with vivid colors against muted backgrounds .

" From a plot and movement standpoint , this movie was terrible . I found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did . Basically , five characters appear in the movie , A Son & Father , son 's girl friend , and two male characters of the son 's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation . The movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism , but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another . There were a couple of brilliant scenes . At the beginning of the movie , the son 's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation . The photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two , ending with her admitting to having another man who was " " older " . " End of that story . , " negative
" I thought this movie was awful . I understand it was shot on a small budget but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just plain dumb . The plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic moron . In fact , all of the characters were unsympathetic and none were fully developed at all . The audience relates to no one in the movie . It was supposed to be suspenseful but if you don 't care about the characters , it 's hard to get " " into " " the movie at all . I felt like an outsider being forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story . All the plot twists at the end were just a little too much - I was actually laughing when I guess I was supposed to be " " shocked .

It was SO bad whenever Doug McClure came on-screen I prayed that i had flashbacks of Small Wonder ( Yes , i know Doug was in " " Out of this world " " & not " " small Wonder " , " but it 's pretty much the same damn show , & i can hum the " " small wonder " " theme better ) There are movies that are so bad they 're good. this isn 't one of thoseWhere i saw it : Showtime BeyondMy Grade : F-Eye Candy : Mako Hattori gets topless , Susan George gets 2 love scenes ( one nude , one just topless ) , " negative
" Arthur Miller has always been known as one of America 's great playwrights for works such as " " Death of a Salesman " " and " " The Crucible " . " " " Focus " " is one of his lesser known plays brought to the silver screen . However , knowing what a great playwright Arthur Miller is , I doubt that his original play was very much like the movie . The movie comes across as empty and formulaic , with William H. Macy as a non-Jew mistaken for a Jew by anti-Semitic neighbors in WWII Brooklyn . Don 't get me wrong : the acting is OK , and I presume that the people behind this movie were probably trying to make a point about racism , but the movie just doesn 't work . Macy , Laura Dern and David Paymer just can 't create an effective story with the material here . , " negative

I was so excited to see the cast in this movie that I was completely surprised at how completely WRONG this movie was . I love John Voight but I have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this travesty . The Biblical accuracy was completely non-existent and I honestly could not stomach watching the movie with my children .

" The Tooth Fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that lures children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives . The first few minutes introduce you to the 1949 beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switches to present day . The worn out horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid acting . They could have done without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes , but overall the gore scenes were bloody but quick which had a minimizing effect . The eye candy is pretty good for both genders . Camera work is good . Dialog is fair but cheesy . I expected the film to be a bare bones , low budget , slasher with very few redeeming factors . I was surprised by the quality of the film . , " negative
There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn 't help with the major downsides to the movie . I never understand why directors ask actors / actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can 't convince . Fiennes just can 't do Irish and Fitzgerald isn 't much better at Russian . When the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing . As the for the major problem .... the plot .... was there one ? I guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that I just couldn 't wait for the film to end ... it was ridiculous . Save 90 minutes of your life and don 't watch this movie ! , negative
" I agree with most if not all of the previous commenter 's Tom ( bighouseaz @ yahoo.com ) . The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement.I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16 ; I believe 14 has not been released on Zone 1 ( usa ) . Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing . The story line was complicated , and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous Zatoichi story lines . At one point , I was wondering if I was not seeing a remake of a previous Zatoichi film.This film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects ( a head rolling , limbs severed , blood ) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character . All the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action , and won a great following without having to resort to effects.I am just hoping that the remaining Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend . This is the first Zatoichi film from his studio . I highly recommend all the previous Zatoichi films -- and recommend them . , " negative
" First time of seeing Buster Keaton 's first feature film and I have to admit I liked it a lot and only wish I 'd stumbled across it years ago . The Rohauer blurb at the start warns that the Three Ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion , and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated . So , it 's rocky viewing in places , but I 've seen and survived much worse.It would have been OK as the 3 short films but as a take on Intolerance it 's inventive and funny from the start to the finish : In the Stone Age with baddie Wallace Beery riding an elephant and goodie Buster riding a pet brontosaurus ; In the Roman Age Buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging , No Parking signs in Latin ; In this technological Age of Speed Need and Greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump . Both him and Beery are after the Girl through the ages , a never ending tussle . Favourite bit : As the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera - an amazing second or two ! Great stuff , reaffirming my love of silent film comedy . , " positive
" For a movie I was really looking forward to , I was very disappointed . I had no expectations of this being another Amadeus , but did expect a more significant portrayal of Beethovens last years.The performance by Ed Harris was superb , but the story line was so weak that the film simply moved from one dreary scene to the next with no continuity.The only enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the 9th , and from that point on I could quite happily have walked out without finishing.I left feeling very dissatisfied and still have the feeling that something important was missed . , " negative
" I saw this movie the other night . I can 't even begin to express how much this movie sucked . The writing , the voice acting , even the claymation . Terrible , Terrible , Terrible . It 's like watching 24 hours of C-Span for the sake of comedy . It just doesn 't work . It literally falls flat at about every spot possible.Also , the movie 's animation is very poor quality . I know that this is an movie made by one person , but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap , maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny.This show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time . Yikes . It really was that bad . If you 're looking for a movie that will make you laugh , steer clear from this abomination . My advice : Don 't even buy it , or look it up for that matter . Your brain will than you . , " negative
" First saw this gem from Joe Sarno way back when , and I must say that after seeing it , I could never forget Jennifer Welles . At first I thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a Sarno film , but when Jennifer made her entrance , the first time I ever saw her anywhere , I was sat up and took notice . Her presence in this film is hard to avoid , and spices up every scene she 's involved in . I 've seen most of the rest of Sarno 's films , and the other films starring or featuring Jennifer Welles , and I must say that this was both Sarno and Jennifer at their collective best . Sarno 's direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb , and Jennifer showed ( figuratively and literally ) an acting prowess that make this a must see . Co-stars Rebecca Brooke ( aka Mary Mendum ) and Chris Jordan , both frequent co-stars of Ms. Welles , and also frequent stars of Sarno 's work , turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous , yet normal housewives . This film is Sarno classic . , " positive
" Here 's why the Jane Show won 't work . Once again Canadian bonehead producers and writers can 't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it . I guess these people don 't watch a lot of T.V. from the U.S. which has the sitcom model down pat . No , here we have to do something different , we have to make the A story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful B story to try to make up for it . The characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top : Forklift races ? ? ? give me freaking break . Here 's a little advice for the writers of the show , Don 't write funny situations , find the funny in situations . And remember , you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff , not just be an improv monkey . , " negative
" The fight scenes play like slow-motion Jackie Chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic ( worst pun by far : " " Guess what ? This time I heard you coming " " ) . The stars are a mismatched pair : Brandon Lee , despite the terrible lines he has to say , actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that Dolph Lundgren is completely free of ( at least in this movie ) .

" This is a made-for-TV and rather needless Sci-fi Channel retelling of the Beowulf story , especially after the recent 2005 film " " Beowulf and Grendel " . " This movie doesn 't really get into Beowulf 's story , but just takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as Grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior , Beowulf is called upon to rid them of the monster 's rampage . If this is successfully accomplished , the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay . After a few failed attempts , the creature is slain , but it 's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks , leaving it up to Beowulf to , again , lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it . " " Grendel " " looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the CG effects are terrible . Like I said , this movie is absolutely needless . , " negative
" Oh my lord , what were they thinking about with this one . It not only is frantically unfunny , but worse , a very good original was trashed in the bargain . Jane Fonda , believe it or not , actually turned in the performance of her life in that one . Even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life . Maybe she is just flat good as a crook . Any other time , wow , what a waste of time . But she and Segal team up beautifully , so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby , catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from.Because very very very little of that one remains , to this ones horror . Nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when Dick and Jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss ..... and uhh ........ oh my lord , that 's it ? Well , looks like it . It truly is that bad a film . , " negative
" It is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of " " acting adult " " is not engaging in sensuality . Instead , these kids see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it . Hoot is a film aimed squarely at families looking for a fun day at the cinema . The production values are good , especially sweeping shots of Montana and Florida . The soundtrack by Jimmy Buffet is a perfect fit . The young actors are spirited and refreshing.The plot , about a trio of kids who work together to save some burrowing owls from death at the hands of an unscrupulous pancake house empire builder , will engage kids . So many films make children appear powerless , it is nice to see a movie that shows children working hard to make a difference . And even though parents are absent or temporarily distracted , it was pleasant to see kids who want to follow in their parents footsteps and try to right injustices.If you are tired of all of the self-indulgent story lines about children that fill the cinema , give Hoot a shot . Then take some time to talk to your kids about the adventure of serving others and caring about the world they live in . A positive message from a positive film . , " positive

" I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast , so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured Scott Baio ( a skateboard chase scene ! ) . Jodie Foster in her first " " grown-up " " role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess . Two hours out of my life that I 'll never get back ! No noteworthy characters , unbelievable storyline , questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all , I couldn 't have cared less .

" Being Of Cephallonian descent , I was happily surprised when watching the movie . I have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in Cephalonia , but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled . It is all true , the Italians would sing , the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often . The earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion . If you haven 't seen the movie go and watch it and read the book , it is not only a love story , and yes , there were plenty of Italians in love with Cephallonian women , in fact , boat loads of Cephallonian women were taken to Italy after the war , it is a true depiction of history . , " positive
" when i sat down to watch this movie i thought that it might be slightly good. but no. it was a OK film , not good , but not bad for most of it but then you get to the ending and it losses all credibility. they should have just left then dead. they did not leave the last bit it did not make any sense. if they had something at they beginning about a plane crash yeah but we didn 't so it didn 't work. the first bit is OK and i give them credit for that but the rest is just plane bad and unnecessary if you are thinking about going and watching this movie DON " " T it is awful go and rent something that is actually worth watching. i give it 2 / 10 , " negative
" Somehow they summed up the 60 's , ten years that radically changed our country , in four hours . And what a painful four hours it was . They trivilized the major events and happenings and they " " claimed " " it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family . If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash . What was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways , but managed to attend every major 60 's event through the country . And the second family was such a non-factor . They devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family . That poor son ... Please NBC , do not make any movies about any other eras .... leave that to PBS and the History Channel , " negative
" Not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires , touching our favorite trash / cult genre is nice . Unfortunately this movie lucks of originality and the performances do not come up with the trash standards . Seem the creator 's intention to make it cult it failed . Trash movies are trash movies because it happens . You cant create in purpose this kind of films.I don 't know if Mr Creepo is a legend ( first time i heard his name ) BUT if he is i wonder the reason ... Awful . Even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic x-ploitation films will not be satisfied , as there a thousands of movies better than Barely Legal Lesbian Vampires . , " negative
" This is the final episode we deserved . At the end of the last season , things were left in a ' life goes on ' mood , which was hardly the wrap-up that this realistic series deserved . While not a happy show , this series was always one that made you think ( a rare thing on television ) , and this is no exception . ' Is death justified by reasoning ? ' ' Are morals reflective of society , or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power ? ' ' What is a just death , and can it exist ? ' All of these questions , and more , are posed by the writers of this show every week , and this is their final thesis . Fine acting , great writing , wonderful camera-work , brilliant editing , clean direction . If you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran , then get a hold on a copy somehow . If you never watched the series when it ran , then this will stand up on its own , but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts . For those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons , this is very satisfying viewing . , " positive
" this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen. this is slow , plot less and boring. the cinematographer deserved to be shot .

If u hate someone , recommend they buy or rent this. big waste of time and money . Thanks Gus Van Sant ... not. i cant think of anything else to say except Don 't ever see this movie , it will make u want to jump off a cliff .

" Skippy from Family Ties goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie . The film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves - except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave ( using Skippy to help out ) . And while the plot is corny and cliche , the corniness ( for example , an evil green fog taking off a girl 's clothes ) and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious ( and great ) . And of course , there 's nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who 's asking what happened to the love song : ) . Definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh . And while you 're at it , make it a double feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there 's an " " evil rocker " " ( as stated on the video box ) driller killer in black leather w / fringe . A must see for cheesy movie fans . , " positive

" This is the kind of film that , if it were made today , it would probably star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant ; actually , now that I think about it , this one is quite liable to be remade one day .

It suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for , and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak .

" Johnny Knoxville and the boys of Jackass go over the top for " " Jackass Number Two . " " At a press screening , the laughter was so loud and raucous it was hard to hear all the dialog . The stunts are over the top and the pranks are funnier and more outrageous than ever before.All of the guys put their limbs on the line to make a great film , and they succeeded . If you like this genre , you 'll love this film . If not , don 't bother.Some of the funniest bits are the pranks the guys play on themselves , and they have no regard for what happens to them . They 'll do anything to make a stunt work . Many critics panned Johnny Knoxville for a less active role in the first film , but not to worry , he is front and center in Number Two , and they have enough footage in the can to be half way through a Number Threee.This is a must see for fans of this type of humor.Chris Sansone , Entertainment Editor , Fort Bend Herald , " positive
" Henri Verneuil 's film may be not so famous as Parallax View , 3 Days of the Condor or JFK but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre . Action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed . After several years of investigation , special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman . But one man - prosecutor Volney , played by Yves Montand - thinks there 's something more to be investigated and so the film starts . This movie doesn 't deal with some exact theories , but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in today 's world . Such film could be made only in the 1970-ies but it will never lose it 's actuality . Furthermore , it 's even a bit frightful how precise are it 's oracles . 10 out of 10 . , " positive
" You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a disaster . The question is not , " " How did it get made , " " because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film , they will do so.No. The question is " " Why , oh why , did Steve Martin allow it to be made ? " " I think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything . He knew the sequel was going to be so frightful , that out of pride , he wouldn 't even count it 's royalties as income . The only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation 's favorite poor black family.And " " dcreasy2001 " " ( aka Mark Blankfield ? ) : It 's just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity , and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel 's lone cheerleader as an IMDb user comment .

" The 1990 's begun to have day time talk shows sprout up left and right . Every network had one , and they all lacked one thing Originality .

The English language and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence . Titltes ranging from Girl you a Pigeon Head and so on . How could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage ? Has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy 's and dead beat fathers ? The people who appear on this show were Trash . The people who watched this show were Trash . Anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto DVD is TRASH .

" Well , you 'd better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish , bland , and pokey flick about a middle-aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like . Set in Tunis , mom piddles around the flat , gets antsy , and decides , albeit reluctantly ( she just can 't help herself ) , to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret . Meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons . The common denominator is a Tunisian band drummer . This film is so full of filler I watched the DVD at x2 and read the subtitles , fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking ( they walk everywhere ) and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring , uneventful , low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits .

" I love old " " monster movies " " for the pure camp value . This one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing.The acting is pure 1950s stilted crap . You do get used to it when you 've seen enough of these ... the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable . You 're just there for the giant bird.The " " science " " in this movie is hilarious . A monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti-matter ... intent on wreaking havoc and eating people ... an alien who has come to Earth to nest . Some of the best scenes in the movie ( that don 't have the bird in them ) include the " " scientists " " explaining what is going on.A lot has been said about the ridiculous bird marionette . It looks like a new baby bird ... bald and ugly with ruffled feathers . It even caws like a hungry , angry fledgling . However , the bird scared the crap out of my three year old , who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening . It 's a bit creepy.I was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg .

" A powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and the smash Broadway play about the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delany , two " " colored " " sisters who lived past the age of 100 . Wonderfully played in their old age by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll , respectively , they tell their story in flashbacks to Amy Hill Hearth ( played by Amy Madigan ) , a white New York Times reporter . The flashback and present-day scenes don 't have as much inspirational value in them as in the book , but really are powerful . However , certain aspects of the sisters ' lives , such as the inter-racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their father 's stern personality are not presented clearly . You need to read the book to fully understand these things . Which is just as well , because the book 's just as great !

" This focuses around the lives of four women , all good friends , and their male companions . Each has a story , the men as well , everything links everybody to everybody and everything is being brought to a quick change after a trip the girls take to Palm Springs.Basically , the film is no different from other of the genre , but I liked the details . Brooke Shields is a divorc챕e that fears loneliness , therefore she bangs just about everybody to get to have a " " warm body " " next to her in the morning , but then can 't really commit . As a man , I find these women are a blessing : ) , but she is not a happy person . Everything else that happens revolves around this crazy woman , but in the end we get more clarity over life and relationships , which is good.I can 't tell if the acting was bad .

" While I can 't say whether or not Larry Hama ever saw any of the old cartoons , I would think that writing said cartoons , file cards , and some of the comics would count for something.For fans of the old cartoon , this is pretty much a continuation of the same , except with a few new characters - and a more insane Cobra Commander.We still have all the old favorites too , but on a personal note , one thing that always irritated me was this " " Duke in charge " " stuff , when there are tons of other * officers * around instead.The battle sequences are similar to the old series as well ; the main trick here seems to be the CGI .

" I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie . Granted , it 's Shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not . But this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not , that may prevent many from just not caring about a Shakespeare based story.The largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters . Often during character 's interacting , it 's nearly difficult to distinguish who 's lines are who 's . Granted , I believe this movie is dubbed in English . Certainly they could 've obtained voice actors which could 've added a bit more drama to these classic , literary lines.It would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1 , although perhaps that 's based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget . Still , it 's absolutely painful and boring . If you insist on Hamlet , do yourself a favor and read the book again . 1 / 10 , " negative
" No real plot to this one , just a series of short skits acting out some VERY old jokes . I chuckled once or twice in the beginning , much to my chagrin .

Its just that it 's all too predictable , i felt like i was watching a made for TV drama instead of a new movie . Maybe thats the style the directors wanted , but it has to be said that the review i read on here before i saw the movie could only have been written by someone involved in its production.Don 't expect too much , and if i could wind the clock back i wouldn 't have gone to see it at the cinema .

" This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day . A wealthy upper class English woman schemes , plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction . She uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti-social kind . There 's a clever sex-role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters . But naturally there 's a tall , dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest , and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man.The wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme , but those who thirst for Romance will overlook that . , " negative

" Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival , over three years ago . I went in with no expectations since Christopher Nolan was a no-name at the time , but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival . It worked well on the big screen , with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood . Mr.Nolan gave a good account of its making at the end , enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker !

Absolutely horrific film . Ameteurish and it isn 't funny at all . Lead character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying .

Rating : 10 of 10.PS : I admit it : I shed a tear of joy during the final scene . , " positive
" This movie had all the elements to be a smart , sparkling comedy , but for some reason it took the dumbass route . Perhaps it didn 't really know who its audience was : but it 's hardly a man 's movie given the cast and plot , yet is too slapstick and dumb-blonde to appeal fully to women.If you have seen Legally Blonde and its sequel , then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel . Great actors such as Luke Wilson should expect better material . Jessica Simpson could also have managed so much more . Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing.Many things in this movie were paint-by-numbers , the various uber-clich챕 montages , the last minute " " misunderstanding " , " even the kids ' party chaos . This just suggests lazy scriptwriting.It should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you don 't take it seriously , but it 's such a glaring could-do-better than you 'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll past . , " negative
" This movie was hysterical . I haven 't laughed this hard in a long time . I mean , it 's not " " Good Will Hunting , " " but was it supposed to be ? I actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised . The comedy hits hard and is fairly constant . Amanda Peet is hot and awesome . The entire audience that I screened it with seemed to be enjoying the film as much as I did . , " positive
" This movie is a touching story about an adventure taken by 15-year-old Darius Weems . Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy , a still un-curable disease that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the number one killer of babies in the United States . Him and a few close friends travel across the country to Los Angeles with the goal of getting his wheelchair customized on MTV 's , Pimp My Ride , one of his favorite shows . The journey begins in Georgia , where Darius grew up and has never left . The gang head west for a trip that all its participants will never forget . Darius gets to ride in a boat for the first time , ride in a hot air balloon , swim in the ocean and visit sights he 's always wanted to see like the Grand Canyon and New Orleans . The filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material . They make no money from sales of the $ 20 dvds . $ 17 goes toward researching the disease and $ 3 goes toward making more copies . The film has won over 25 awards at festivals and I agree with the quote given to the film by Variety , " " Certain to stir hearts " . " , " positive

... " except for Jon Heder . This guy tanked the entire movie.The plot sounded entertaining . A 29 year old slacker son ( Heder ) still lives with widowed mom ( Keaton ) who happens to meet a new love ( Daniels ) . Slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship . He also meets a girl ( Faris ) .I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris but whoever casted Hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach . Heders performance is annoying , which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy , problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale . At the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you 're upset about the end . In the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me ! , " negative
" The only reason I DVRd this movie was because 1 . I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2 . I 've always heard how awful it was . The movie did not disappoint . The best parts were Shaq 's outfits . The worst parts were , well , just about everything else . My 12 year old son and I just squirmed and couldn 't look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why Max didn 't wish for Kazzam to fix that front tooth of his ! But for all it 's terribleness we just couldn 't stop watching it , the story sucked you in , like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit , it was hypnotic . But it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched " " Kazzam " . " , " negative
" Perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing , albeit , completely corny , to adults . Not a bad film for a low-budget job . Children will be amazed with Santa 's workshop and the " " magic " " that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small , or homes that have no chimneys at all ! Kids will thrill over the Santa 's success at thwarting the nasty devil named Pitch ( complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail ! ) . They will sympathize with the poor little girl who 's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love . And the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents . And what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by Pitch to help capture Santa and ruin Christmas ? In the end , everyone , including the nasty boys , get just what they deserve for Christmas ! The film will endear children to both Santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world . , " positive
" I found myself getting increasingly angry as this movie progressed.Basically , Dr. Crawford ( Dennis Hopper ) has predicted a meteor will hit the earth . The " " powers that be " " don 't believe him so he sets about building a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people.Jake Lowe ( Peter Onorati ) is a down on his luck reporter for a trashy tabloid who gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead that something is going on in the mountains . He sets out to investigate.While trying to get into the secret survival shelter Jake spends a great deal of time shooting people to death or beating them to within an inch of their lives . He spends the rest of his time bitching at Dr. Crawford about who gave the doc the right to decide which people should get to survive the meteor.I found myself wishing Jake would do the future a big favor and turn a gun on himself.Don 't waste your time on this turkey . , " negative
" Now I remember what the ' indie ' filmmakers were ripping off before Pulp Fiction . It was David Lynch , right ? I hunted this thing down to see Kyle Secor . What a waste of a perfectly good Bayliss . It was so painful to watch him , sort of like when someone you love is horribly sick and there 's nothing you can do.Nearly every cliche in the book : the desert , the psycho , the quirky mob boss , the biker , Tracy Walker ( who fortunately was only in one scene , but I kept expecting him to reappear and say something strange and profound like " " If a man wants to know where he 's going , he 's got to look at where he 's been , " " or some contrived garbage like that ) . I have a theory as to why so many indies are short on location in the desert . I think it 's because they can save money on lighting.If you like to be in pain , find this movie and give it a viewing . If you 're a fan of Kyle Secor , watch reruns of Homicide on Court TV . If you want a good , quirky road thriller , check out Wild At Heart.There is a reason that no one has heard of Delusion ! My god , what a waste of a good title . , " negative
" I have just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD . The acting throughout is excellent - no question . There was not quite enough action for me I must say . No real suspense as such , just plenty of first class character development . Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of " " whodunnit " . " If you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you . Peter Egan as the lead Magnus Pym is excellent.The film portrayed the life of a traitor . A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things . As a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time & time again as a crook and a con man . Pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him ( wife , son , mentor ) . Pym is fatally damaged by his father 's influence - it has eaten his moral fibre away . He has no real love or loyalty in him.Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series . Very well done though . , " positive
" This movie is plain fun.I has nothing to do with the original America Pie , but it is fun to watch.Another try , but better than Band camp and The naked mile , at least funnier.Just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out , so I decided to call my friend and we would watch it together.We had a few beers and we had fun.You will not find any deep message in this movie , but it 's worth watching.So , lay back and just enjoy . , " positive
" When I was a kid we always used to be babysat , and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema . This is one of the films we watched . This is one of the stupidest films I 've ever seen , I think it might even be a Walt Disney Pictures film ! A martian is dropped on earth , turns into a human , befriends a human , and is trying everything he can to get back home . But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth . The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors , Back to the Future 's Christopher Lloyd as the martian , Uncle Martin , Dumb and Dumber 's Jeff Daniels as Tim O 'Hara , Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie . But apart from that it 's complete crap . Poor ! , " negative
" Like TALK RADIO , THE BOOTH is actually kinda predictable ( TALK RADIO because we know the truth of what happened going in , THE BOOTH because of- let 's face it- the genre and the basic set-up ) . That 's not necessarily a bad thing , in this case . It means , in essence , that the filmmakers don 't punk out in the end the way they might 've in , say , an American version of this story . THE BOOTH moves inexorably toward its ( foregone ) conclusion , but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of ( very scenic ) road . It reminds me of Harlan Ellison 's spooky short story , FLOP SWEAT . The claustrophobia is , at times , almost palpable . Worth a nice long look . , " positive
" Released at a time when Duvivier was going again from strength to strength . " " Black Jack " " which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary " " Au Royaume des Cieux " " and the dazzling stunning " " Sous Le Ciel de Paris " " , is a jumble , which Duvivier himself hated , which is not surprising.There 's almost nothing to write about this dud.We can notice that : 1.Orson Welles used to admire Duvivier .That may explain why Wellesian actors were featured in Duvivier 's movies : Joseph Cotten in " " Lydia " " ( 1941 ) , and here a totally wasted Agnes Moorehead .It 's the first timeI have not enjoyed Moorehead 's performance ! On the other hand , Welles borrowed his Desdemona ( Suzanne Cloutier ) from Duvivier 's " " Au Royaume des Cieux " " for his " " Othello " . " 2.In any Duvivier 's movie , there 's one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception : the search in the caves where Duvivier 's sense of mystery works wonders ( for a short while ) ; then the chase when Dalio gets caught up in the fishnets.Duvivier 's touch can be felt in the unhappy end too.As for the rest , as my dear pen pal writer 's reign writes , it 's a black joke . , " negative
" This film was a yawn from titles to credits , it 's boring to the point of tedium and the acting is wooden and stilted ! Admittedly this was director Richard Jobson directing debut , but who on earth green-lit a script as poorly developed as this one ? Looks like another money down the drain government project ( Scottish Screen are credited surprise , surprise ) . I nearly fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one . Please , please mister Jobson what ever you 've been doing prior to directing this sedative of a film , go back to it ! , " negative
" First of all , f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft.Secondly , the f14 's and f18 's cannot change their appearances ; they are not transformers . Thirdly , the f16 has only one m61 cannon , not two . Last but not the least , at the end of the film , Seagle selected sidewinder missile . But somehow when he pulled the trigger , the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick . As I have the experience of seeing f18 's and f14 's being mysteriously transformed into f16 's , this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me . However , there is still one question I have to ask : How did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16 ... When students hand in really bad work , teachers assign 0 's . Now I think for the sake of properly marking this film , IMDb should seriously consider adding a ' 0 / 10 ' option . Otherwise , it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10 ... , " negative
" This is one of the best episode from the second season of MOH , I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He kill 'em all , they are often the victims ( Screwfly solution , Pro-life , Valerie on the stairs , I don 't remember the Argento 's episode in season 1 , etc . , obviously Imprint ) . I think he enjoys to watch women been burn , torture , mutilated and I don 't know . Never least " " Right to die " " is one of the best , with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense ( specially with the photos from the cell scene , wonderful ) . The acting is like the entire series , regular I could be worst like " " Pro-life " " or " " We scream for Ice cream " . " Also I think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode . The ideology of the series is horrible , killing and terminating women , mutilating animals and on and on ... the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like " " Cigarrette burns " " ( The best of all ) , " " Homecoming " " ( The most funny ) , " " Imprint " " ( really shocking ) . , " positive

You all suck , and none of you are funny . Oh , and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil-worshipper who idolizes Hitler and tortures animals . And she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her " " music " " in hopes to make children kill their parents and kill themselves ! But it was just a rumor . Anyway , this is the worst show ever , Reba is gay , I do not like her , I think The Office is better than this show , and this show sucks . , " negative
" New York family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television set , which nearly ruins David Niven 's marriage to Mitzi Gaynor . Bedroom comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom ( and nothing sexy happens there anyway ) . Gaynor as an actress has about as much range as an oven--she turns on , she turns off . Film 's sole compensation is a supporting performance by perky Patty Duke , pre- " " Miracle Worker " , " as Niven 's daughter .

" I gather at least a few people watched it on Sept.2 on TCM . If you did you know that Hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the U.S. It was a huge scandal and I gather that the original release in the U.S. was so chopped up by censors that it was practically unintelligible . I watched because I had just seen a documentary on " " bad women " , " actresses in the U.S. pre- movie censorship board set up in the early ' 30s . It looked to me as though they got away with a lot more than Hedy 's most " " sensational " " shots in " " Ecstasy " . " In fact Hedy looked positively innocent in this , by today 's standards , and it was nice to see her early unspoiled beauty . It was a nice , lyrical movie to relax to . I loved it for what it was : a simple romance . I watched it after pre- recording it during a sleepless early A.M. I would love to see the first version released in the U.S. for comparison 's sake . , " positive
" The novelty of hearing clean-cut Jay Leno spout four-letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched-police-partners caper . In COLLISION COURSE , the pelican-faced comedian teams up with the late Pat Morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger ( think car lover Leno played a hand in the plot ? ) . The two leads try hard , they really do , but Leno is no actor and Morita 's fish-out-of-water routine gets old in a hurry . The film carries a bit of cheesy ' 80s appeal , but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong 100-minute running time . Fans of Leno 's considerable comedic talents will feel let down ; everyone else will just be bored . , " negative
" Being the prototype of the classical Errol Flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in Maureen O 'Hara ( what an exquisite beauty ! ) and Anthony Quinn , I can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure.Hollywood at its best ! , " positive
" The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy . It 's hardly a comedy , rather a dull indie film about a group of losers . Supposedly set in the 70s , there is scant attention paid to period details , with overly muted color correction taking its place . The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film ( perhaps that is the point , but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience . ) Apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location , the bleachers . It seems like the packaging of the film as a comedy is meant to deceive people into renting or buying this film , which is a complete waste of time . , " negative
" First of all i 'd just like to say this movie rawked more than any of the recent crap that hollywood has cooked up out of its bowels . McBain is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle . It has all of the classic elements of a late 80 's / early 90 's action film .... the random gratuitous acts of violence ( ie. when Walken and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money ) , the snapping of necks , the guys on fire , the guys that get blown off buildings , and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings . Walken is at his finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as , " " let 's go sit .......... out on the deck . " " and others that make this film a top buy off of the clearence rack at the local video store. if you have a bloodlust for unnecessary random acts of violence rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst . , " positive
" The Happiest Days of Your Life showcases some of Britain 's greatest comedy talents of its time in a traditionally farcical and upper-class-twit like fashion . Generally it is a whistle-stop tour of stuffy English behaviour with the girls-only school providing a great setting for the dotty goings-on . Margaret Rutherford , Alastair Sim and - most especially ! - Joyce Grenfell are all fantastic , giving us a lot of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with . As the film moves on , things get sillier and sillier with the tour around the school for the parents being a suitably crackers high point.At this point I will give special mention , again , to Joyce Grenfell and her wonderful character Miss Gossage . She is so extraordinarily innocent , silly , apologetic and ineffectual that she seems to steal the whole film . She provides the greatest laugh of the film when she flirts with a male teacher ( " " Call me sausage ! " " ) .Whilst some of the film is slow or dated , and not always very involving , it still maintains most of its sparkle and barely pauses for romance . Good for a silly , harmless giggle.7 / 10 , " positive

" What a waste of precious time ! My 5-year-old daughter brought this home from my mother 's house , and we watched it as a family . None of us liked it . This wretched little film , rife with glaring inconsistencies , overt Christian themes and horrible film quality , is not worth watching even on a dare . It felt a bit like a bad high-school drama class attempt at film making . How sad to see talented actors ( Chris Atkins , Gary Busey , and company ) flounder their way through this trite and insipid storyline . The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the dog is cute . The film can should have gone straight to the pound .

" this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarity , truth , fun , talent and circumstance that make for MAGIC. from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best , if i hadn 't have known better , i would have thought there was an elaborate script here.what you get : a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it 's own entity.peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts ....... only small actors , and everyone involved here should be patted on the back , taken out to dinner and be considered for an Oscar.well done ! , " positive
" When " " The Net " " was first being advertised , the ads made it look ridiculous . Then , when I saw it , it was actually quite good . Angela Bennett ( Sandra Bullock ) spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors . Then , through a series of events , her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people , and she can 't prove that she exists.Some parts of the movie are a little bit far-fetched ; you 'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie .

" I am a Christian , and thought this movie was pretty good ! : ) While the acting wasn 't Academy Award caliber , I thought it was good , considering the cast has had limited acting experience at the time this movie was made.The Gospel message and the transforming power of Jesus Christ was explained wonderfully . The message that the director was trying to get across ( which is THE important thing , not how the characters dressed ! ) definitely got through . The theme of having the main characters involved in illegal drag racing was a good idea , too ( cool muscle cars , btw ) . I think this movie will definitely reach out to a lot of young people.I would definitely recommend this movie , it is a great witnessing tool ! : ) , " positive

" I think that if I went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the bottom set of English to come up with a script , it would make more sense than this .

" " " Erendira " " is a film from Mexico that is rarely talked about . The film only exists in a low quality VHS format . It 's a shame this film hasn 't been given a DVD release . " " Erendira " " is stunning and gorgeous with its magic-realist images . " " Erendira " " is based on a short story from the novel " " 100 Years of Solitude " . " Erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma 's house . Her evil grandma , played by Irene Papas , forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages . The whole town gets a piece of Erendira , so to speak . Although the subject matter sounds harsh , the film doesn 't exploit sexuality . It 's done in a mature artistic manner . The film also has some amazing costumes . Some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most , are the origami birds that morph into real birds , and a golden orange with a diamond in the center . Erendira is an amazing film , that even manages to throw in humor . This is definitely a film that deserves a special DVD release . As they 'd say in espanol , " " Es muy muy bien ! ! !

The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence . The story is heart-wrenching . The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way . Not your standard melodramatic cuing . Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions . Hope you get a chance to see this film . It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light . , " positive
" Rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion . What makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real , it 's almost hard to remember that it 's only a movie . This is by far Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman 's performance of their careers . The film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit . The only bad thing about this movie is that it 's very difficult to get a copy of it . I have yet to see it other than on Laserdisc . This truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on DVD . It really is that good . , " positive
Loved Joan . Great performance . What isn 't she good in . I watched this film and then Jane Eyre right after ... she just keeps getting better . My heart was racing . Great old movie drama . Just what i want from a classic movie . Facial expressions are worth the whole film . I 'm glad i have it on video . Don 't know what more you need in a film . Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... greed ..... murder .... detectives ...... a trial ..... The costumes are very nice . Makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie ? Wish they still made films like this . Whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie . Films in black and white still hold a certain mystery . , positive
" This is a really dumb movie . It could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting , but it just isn 't.Some aliens hear the broadcast of War of the Worlds when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween . They come to Earth to kill humans , but instead of killing , they make people their slaves and act goofy . The front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space ... not really what they do . These aren 't party aliens , they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices . The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the Jack Nicholson rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses . Other than the aliens , the acting is terrible . The writing is obviously meant for children , because every character is written like a kid.This is a dumb movie , that only children will appreciate , maybe.My rating : 1 / 2 out of * * * * . 100 mins . PG for mild language . , " negative
" After an anonymous phone call about a spacecraft that would have crashed in a frozen wood , two police officers find evidences that the event really happened and apparently one Martian had walked away from the spot . They drive to the nearby Hi-Way Caf챕 and they find a bus stopped and seven passengers waiting the reopening of a snowed in bridge . However the driver tells that he had only six passengers when he parked the bus . While interrogating the travelers , weird things happen in the diner , with the lights switching on and off and the turntable turning on and off . When the passengers are released and the bus follows his travel , one passenger returns to the diner and discloses a plot of invasion of Earth . " " Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up ?

" Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film . The acting , directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer / director / star Larry Bishop to get laid . The only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with QT . The plot of the film is pretty flimsy , and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older B-movies and some cameos from guys like David Carradine , Dennis Hopper , and Vinnie Jones . Each one is listless in their performance , particularly Hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career . The saving grace , if there is one , is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining . Bishop tries so hard to get that trademark Tarentino banter and just fails miserably , which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others . I 'd only check this one out if you love bad movies ... or if you 're really into biker films . , " negative
" I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham , AL , which was actually a really fun festival , and was blown away by it . It was the best movie I saw all day by a long shot . A school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together . It 's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality . Story stems from real life occurrences , ripped straight from the headlines . Raw , blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end . The film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity . Definitely not suitable for kids . Too depressing for some people 's tastes . Definitely worth checking out in my opinion though . , " positive
" Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild , but I do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was . The cast was there to do it , but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie . The only problem was that they did not fit . I did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best . I left wondering why i spent my money on this movie . , " negative

" Don 't get me wrong , I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy . I shall digress now . The writing , though , was unrealistic . A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person . Give me a break . The smugness of very pretty Mary Louise Parkers character was an insult to my intelligence . The characters were not at all likable . Basically , the plot lines went nowhere . I understand its only TV land . The hypocrisy was blatant . Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mom and I am supposed to believe this .... WHY ? ? ? ? I just got the feeling I was being preached by a show reeking of seediness . Its like saying its OK to cheat on your wife , but with someone of legal age status . OK not exactly the same thing , but I think you people get my point . That save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign trails , I guess , but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom , as the local pot dealer . , " negative
" Me being one was probably having a brain fart at the time for renting it . Anyone who actually buys it , will enjoy using this as a coaster . Perhaps a frisbee ? This is a dvd I actually found up front where the kids could get to it . Since dvd 's don 't seem to be in the position to be put in that tell tale back room with all the big box vhs tapes are , I find it rather annoying they stuck this up next to a disney film . Yep , going from Dinosaur to Erotic Ghost has shown what we all think of Disney right ? I havent ' stooped that low just yet . There 's no acting in here .

" The following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie : 1 ) Clich챕s abound . Seriously , awful " " twists " " are everywhere.2 ) The narrative jumps around in time , which would be fine if done well , but it 's not.3 ) Lame characters that don 't develop so much as either remain utterly static , or drastically change for no good reason.4 ) Big one : HORRIBLE ACTING . Over the top from nearly every person.The following are some of the best points from the movie : 1 ) The lead is damn good looking.As I see it , there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie : a ) People who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive.b ) People who often think to themselves , " " I like Hollywood dreck rife with clich챕s and overacting , but if only I could watch it in Korean ...

" After stabbing a retarded boy , the fifteen years old troubled and pessimist Leland P. Fitzgerald ( Ryan Gosling ) is sent to a juvenile detention . His teacher and aspirant writer Pearl Madison ( Don Cheadle ) gets close and tries to understand him , first with intention of writing a book , and later becoming his friend . Leland slowly discloses his sad vision of world , showing that he is a sociopath . " " The United States of Leland " " is a depressive and interesting study of a character . The low paced riveting screenplay discloses pieces of the story like a puzzle ; there are excellent lines and dialogs ; the performances are great , although the twenty-three years old Ryan Gosling does not convince as a fifteen years old teenager ; but it seems that a part is missing to complete the puzzle and make " " The United States of Leland " " an unforgettable movie . The disappointing clarification of the " " why " " for the violent action of Leland against Ryan Pollard is not convincing or touching , indeed shows that this character is a totally deranged sociopath with a weird and sick sight of world . Further , the way Allen Harris gets Pearl 's knife is ridiculous . My vote is seven.Title ( Brazil ) : " " O Mundo de Leland " " ( " " The World of Leland " " ) , " positive
" Not even original in the plot . Ho hum . There were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting , but the film follows the path of 90 % of Hollywood movies . I don 't really " " get " " Samuel Jackson 's acting most of the time in his other films , but he was rather good in this film . He rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an " " in your face anger . " " I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and even though she is great eye candy , she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress . Luis Guzman was actually really good also , except that I disliked the change of his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film . How can one 's character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second ? Is there no original thought left in Hollywood ? , " negative
" Dr Tarr 's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients . However , the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be , and the asylum is being run by the patients , and the doctors are in cages . First of all , some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep , and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons ( A guy who thinks he 's a chicken , for instance ) . I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good , but the film itself bombs . The music of the film is really odd and like something you would hear in some insane comedy , and yes , there is a scene involving dancing chicken men , which pretty much made me want to shut off the screen . Watch this film at your own risk ! Rated : R for Violence and Nudity . , " negative
I normally love Jackie Chan movies but this one was terrible . There are only 2 or 3 fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less . The bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasing / racing . The car chase isn 't so bad ( though not as exciting as fighting ) but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring . Basically it takes all of things that make a Jackie Chan film a Jackie Chan film and leaves out everything except Jackie Chan . Even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humour.I suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact I saw one of those horrible dubbed versions . I usually try to see the subtitled version ... I wish I could understand Chinese.I 've only seen one Jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into Hollywood films that didn 't turn out so well.Avoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports . , negative
" I had the TV on for a white noise companion and heard " " $ 400 for a fully furnished apartment " " So I ran into the TV room expecting another 70 's flick and got much more . Luckily , I could rewind to the beginning ( DVR buffer ) and hit the record button to watch it entirely . ( Cinemax uncut and in HD no less ! ) Aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog / events , this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch . Pretty creepy and progressive at times : Beverly D 'Angelo 's character masturbates in front of Alison Parker , played adroitly by Cristina Raines , Parker stabs , in very gory fashion , her father , an explicit menage a trios scene . ( don 't let the kids watch ) The film is TOTALLY 70 's full of bad clothes ( polyester suits and tacky ascots ) and decor , bad hair , over bloated music score , and familiar looking cinematography . The cast is excellent , take a second on this film 's home page to check it out.It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken , Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young . Sylvia Miles- always wonderfully creepy ! ENJOY ! , " positive
" Was it really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in a documentary . And why all the silly dog scenes , and then repetition of all the same silly dog scenes ? This film starts with a great promise - to expose the international politics and the business of wine . It got off to a great start and included all the right characters . But the production is a mess . Points started and developed most of the way , then never finished or left with dangling ends . Very poor and disorienting camera work and editing . They should have used subtitles for the British mumbler from Christie 's.Too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentary.Probably honored at Cannes because of the US bashing ( although in my opinion there was too little of it ) .We left at the 2 : 00 hour mark - I have no idea how much longer it ran on . , " negative

" " " Scary Movie 2 " " is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise . Scary Movie 1 , 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny . Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies.This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night . Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.This movie isn 't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things . It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch - but I don 't think you will like it nearly as much . , " negative
" I 'm in two minds about FOLLOWING , the film debut of Christopher Nolan . Part of me admires it for costing 6,000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house . In many ways it reminds me of the cult movie PI , a film I disliked , and I can 't get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . Wouldn 't it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? Oh well I guess FOLLOWING gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $ 6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn 't made by the director of MEMENTO ? , " negative
" I had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical Genre Hollywood film . Story lines fail , and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste . But , then I saw Zentropa ( Europa ) and my faith was renewed . Not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating . The narrator ( Max Von Sydow ) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into Europa 1945 . We have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow-moving moment that leads you to death . Unlike many films it doesn 't cut after one second of showing ( for example ) a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man 's final moments . I think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means . I would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email . Enjoy it ! , " positive
" When I first viewed the trailer , I have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection . But after hearing about it , I decided to buy it . When I bought the entire collection in a box set , it was absolutely what I wanted to see . It was very funny , and the characters were pretty cool . Favorite characters in the show are : Marion , Carrot , the Haze Knights , Big Momma , and Dotta . I also liked the opening and ending theme songs . The show also has some great voice talents from Tiffany Grant , Jason Douglas , and others . But however , this show is one of the greatest . So if you want to see something cool .

" A squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy . Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks ' desert-spread in Arizona , where government suits have just invested in the family 's herd of cattle ( which is in dire need of a stud ) . What director Peter Tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills , though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages ( his social commentary isn 't exactly pointed , but Tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes ) . Despite colorful supporting turns by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell , the general wackiness gets way out of hand , and there 's too much hoopin ' and hollerin ' to sustain much interest . As for Elvis , he 's loose and frisky throughout--and while it 's nice to see him having fun on-screen , one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point . This shambles of a picture has a distinct what-the-hell feel to it , and though spirits are high , the returns are mostly low . * 1 / 2 from * * * * , " negative
" I just saw this film last night in the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them . The film was simply awful - I say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was awful . Matthew Modine 's days as a leading man are way over . Gina Gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film . Gloria Reuben had a weird little cameo in it - she should also be ashamed . The script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters . I highly doubt this will be picked up , but then again , people in Hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes . I really think " " Kettle of Fish " " is a serious contender for the worst movie I 've ever seen . , " negative
" Excellent plot line makes this movie one of the classic , cult ninja flicks of all time . The plot being that this woman 's soul is possessed by an evil ninja spirit . I mean to be honest if i could obtain ninja ability through possession I would . Furthermore , for being in the 80 's and such the fact that the ninja aspect was far greater in this particular decade is evident and despite all that , Ninja 3 The Domination manages to keep it original from the American Ninja cookie cutter molds that plagued the 80 's for so long . This chick is definitely Michael Dudikoff on steroids .... I mean the first American ninja was great but let 's get real folks it has nothing on Ninja 3 , " positive

" This was my first introduction to the world of Bollywood and I 'm now hooked ! Okay so it requires adoption of a different mindset to watching US films but once you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is you won 't be disappointed . The songs are superb , melodic and very catchy . The actors are visually compelling especially Karisma Kapoor who is surely one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world .

" About 20 minutes into this lame excuse for a movie , I realized it reminded me of one of those annoying people at work who 're always telling really lame jokes or doing extremely unfunny things , because they think it 's funny and are trying to entertain everyone . This film is billed as starring Traci Lords , she 's not that bad of an actress , but her lines aren 't funny and SHE 'S NOT THE STARThe acting is some of the most god-awful I 've ever seen , except for Lords , the girl who plays Casey , and maybe the Colonel-who seems oddly out of place . I can 't imagine why a retired military Colonel would want to start a SNOWBOARDING ACADEMY . Do those even exist ? The budget would 've been better spent coaxing these women into doing a full length porn feature . " " Freddy Got Fingered " " currently has a 3.5 score , " " Frostbite " " has a 2.7 .

" This film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever . Ever . But in my opinion it is possibly the funniest . The horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless . I bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain DVD 's at my local pound shop . Me and some friends then watched it , admittedly whilst rather drunk . It soon occurred that this wasn 't any normal film . Instead a priceless relic of what will probably be James Cahill 's last film . At first we were confused and were screaming for the DVD player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no-one could be bothered . Instead we watched the film right through . At the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream , something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours , whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons . We soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed , this wasn 't a work of abysmal film . This was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at . This was a film that anyone can enjoy .

" My family truly enjoyed this movie . As far as what this movie will do for Rugby in the USA ... well I am sure that will be debatable . But as for me and others around me , I know that we were more curious about the sport after seeing the movie and I personally gained more respect for the game . You may wonder how this possible , especially since the movie does not dive in and explain Rugby . But the simple fact is it drew you into the players and emotion of the game and life . The film was inspirational as well as entertaining . It made us laugh and cry . The chemistry between Sean Astin , Big Budah and Sean Faris worked well . Some may think the movie is a little clich챕 , but I seriously wish Hollywood made more movies like this . I couldn 't help drawing analogies of the game and life 's struggles . At the end of it I found myself examining my own life to see what I needed to do better , in order to be the best person I could be .

The only positive thing I can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now I finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie I ever saw was called.It would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable ... a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even . Why would anyone want to produce such waste ? I refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented . Making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point .

We all at times wish that we could relive our lives as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults . Wouldn 't it be nice to have all your friends / parents be young again ?

The film sped along with me never looking at my watch and I enjoyed every second of the film . If you liked East is East then you 'll love this film . OK so the storyline is nothing new , and the classic storylines are contained within the film but it 's all done very funnily , and with a breath of fresh air .

Turns out this movie is about my dad & his friends.Even without it being about loosely based on my dad 's childhood , i 'd say watch this movie !

" I have zero interest rap and in ghetto culture , i 'm white and like classic rock , however , that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy . Its pretty much a sequel of This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it is the same movie , just about rap instead or rock . Yet it 's hilarious . There are many funny jokes but not without a few jokes that just fall flat . The characters are all very funny and believable . I watched just because it made me laugh at 3 a.m. , and any movie that can do that warrants at least a test screening . One of the reasons why this movies was so funny was that it makes fun of rap from a different . Rap today is concerned with the wrong things and get by with studio noise and little talent . This movie comes from a time where rappers deserved more credit . Overall , it 's a funny movie with many jokes about racism , sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor . This is highly recommend for any fan of This is Spinal Tap . They are essentially the same movie , just about different worlds , and yes , the same jokes work in both movies . , " positive
" an awesome made for the sci-fi channel movie which by far surpasses many of the poor previous efforts they 've churned out . Bruce Campbell is on superb form as a possible investor who gets caught up in a bizarre experiment led by a delirious professor , Stacey Keach , and his half-wit assistance , Ted Raimi . The film is pure b movie gold and its great to see Keach and ram up on screen with Bruce , and the fact that a lot of the film works purely on Bruce 's comic slapstick acting is what make it hilarious , and makes me ask the question , why isn 't this guy getting more of his scripts commissioned ? , it indeed a sick world . Definitely worth a watch . , " positive
" Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made ! If you love Bringing Up Baby , The Philadelpia Story , The Thin Man , I Was A Male War Bride or It 's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit , taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek , check this one out . Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed.Grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire . Loy is adorable as his pre-NOW wife . The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can 't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker . Art Direction and Editing are way above par.The movie never stoops to the low-rent , by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit . , " positive
" I saw the film tonight at a free preview screening , and despite the fact that I didn 't pay a dime to see this film I still felt ripped off . Ladies and gentlemen , time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a Benjamin on your seat . The acting is torpid at best ; Kiefer Sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of Jack Bauer , and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey . Eva Longoria is a non-entity ; she looks like she 's reading her lines off a teleprompter . And if you can 't spot the " " mole " " within the first 20 minutes , then you just landed on this planet from a world without TV and recycled story lines . If you truly want to see a good secret service thriller , rent In the Line of Fire . If you see and buy into this one , you 'll start to fear for the president 's safety because the Secret Service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210 . No matter what your feelings about W , let 's hope this " " art " " does not imitate life . , " negative
" Soylent Green is a classic . I have been waiting for someone to re-do it.They seem to be remaking sci-fi classics these days ( i.e. War of the Worlds ) and I am hoping some director / producer will re-do Soylent Green . With todays computer animation and technology , it would have the potential to be a great picture . Anti-Utopian films may not be that far-fetched . The human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it . We , as humans , have the option of putting the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species if they get out of hand , but there 's nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves . Despite all the diseases , wars , abortions , birth control , etc. the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish . Classic Malthusian economics states that any species , including humans , will multiply beyond their means of subsistence . 6 billion and growing .... that 's obscene . , " positive
" Robert Urich was a fine actor , and he makes this TV movie believable . I remember watching this film when I was 15 , and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same . People lose who they were when enter this exclusive club , in a computer rich Californian town . Urich try 's to figure out what is wrong with his family , and I love the Halloween space suit idea , brilliant . This film is about the battle of one 's sprit . TV quality , that exceeds , the big budget , Gangs of New York . I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie ? I hope so ! 6 or 7 out of 10 . , " positive
" Formula flick of guy who wants girl , guy who will lie to get next to girl , guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way ( comedus reliefus , no ? ) to help deceive girl , etc . This one 's been done to death , and with rare exception of a few z-rated outings , it 's been done better.Stale plot aside , the leads are attractive and there 's a couple of good moments . Jonathon Schaech has done better , and his acting here came close to being phoned in . Not a complete loss , but nothing new here in this tepid affair . , " negative
" God , did I hate this movie ! I saw it at a sneak preview 13 years ago , and I STILL have bad flashbacks . It was , without a doubt , the WORST movie I ever paid to see . It was badly written , badly directed , and ( surprisingly considering the cast ) badly acted . I would rather be thrown off a rooftop onto razor sharp spikes , and then have my skin peeled off , than to sit through it again . Can you guess I didn 't enjoy it ? , " negative
" Stumbled over this film on Amazon.com. Had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of German movies I bought a copy ... Have to say that I was not impressed . The production values are cheap , the story is derivative , the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughs.I wanted to like this but I just found it lackluster and dull . Or maybe I expected more of independent German cinema than a gay spin on The Full Monty and a cast of stereotypes.There are bits in the film that make no sense at all , like one of the Leather Bear 's trying to get Ecki in a sling --like he 'd even look at him twice ? Or the vengeful ex-wife turning up at the match but ending up cheering for her estranged gay husband ? Bunkum is not the word ! Well , at least it explains the movies UK title , I suppose ... , " negative
" Here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life . This time the target audience is preteen girls , the fact of life is menstruation . This animated film , created by Walt Disney Pictures , apparently with some sponsoring from Kotex.It starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop . With the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body , especially the ovaries , uterus and vagina , work and why this all leads to menstruation . It is almost amazing , becoming the comic note here , how the subject of sex is avoided . Even the word is never mentioned although " " furtilized " " will pass once . I don 't really know why I saw this , but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time , you might want to give it a try . , " negative
" I haven 't yet read the Kurt Vonnegut book this was adapted from , but I am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen . Overall , I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut 's novels . It concerns the story of an American living in Germany who is recruited as a spy for the US . His job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked Nazi 's and send secret messages to the American 's via his weekly radio show . But when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to New York , where various odd plot twists await.If Mother Night has a problem it 's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times . But for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb . And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing Christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked Nazi in a prison cell . Very much recommended . , " positive
" A beautiful film.John Garfield 's character is a distant relative of " " Les Miserables " " ' s Jean Valjean while detective Rains recalls Victor Hugo 's Javert , the ruthless arm of law.Like in many films noirs , the city epitomizes evil whereas the country and the nature represents sanctuary , redemption , and a second chance for those whose life seems forever doomed.But even in the luminous daylight , danger may appear suddenly , as the excellent scene at the reservoir shows.John Garfield -an actor who , as Leonard Maltin points out , should be rediscovered : I 've never been disappointed by any of his films except for his supporting part in " " gentleman 's agreement " " but it was not his fault-gives a heartfelt sensitive performance and the audience sides with him as soon as he is unjustly accused ( the first sequence shows a rather unkind hypocrite person , but all his trials redeem him and how do we feel for him during the last scenes with detective Rains.Colorful characters ( grandma and the kids ) add a lot of joie de vivre which is necessary .Humor is also present in the strip poker game as the Dead End brats fleece a rich kid.I recommend this movie . , " positive
" I don 't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before . Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood . It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up . Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde . I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it . Watch it ! ! If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie , you must definitely see The Princess Bride . , " positive
" I loved watching " Sea Hunt " back in the day , I was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by 4 : 30 would be ready to watch " Sea Hunt " and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures .I loved it ! He took to you a place not very accessible at that time , under the great blue sea . Pre " Thunderball " or even before Cousteau became common , there was Mike Nelson sparking the imagination of kids .I 'd be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show .Underwater photography also progressed , the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show .

" I think this is one of the best tamil movies i 've seen in a while. i love the fact that it doesn 't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly . The cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl . She was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother . Best of all are the songs , beautiful music and moving lyrics . There are some great songs in this move ya 'll ! especially ' Kannathil Mutthamittal ' and ' Velai Pookal ' . Great songs , both of them . I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting ( and superb songs ! ) . Cheers Simran . , " positive
" This is just plain bad . Sometimes remakes , even if they stray from the original , are good on their own . They can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable . This was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be . This wasn 't any good even standing on it 's own . Viggo Mortenson is a top-notch actor , but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired . The original " " Vanishing Point " " was such a thrilling , psychological adventure ; this is not an adventure at all , and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever . This was made from a by-the-numbers approach to film-making , stuffing in plot points that someone in Hollywood believes will please what they see as today 's film-going audience . Basically , they see us as a bunch of idiots . It 's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film , and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily . The manipulative plot devices , the " " make-it-obvious-so-they-don 't-miss-the-point " " aspects , ridiculous dialogue , stereotyped characters , amateurish direction ... This is plain bad .... , " negative
" After seeing the ' oh so acclaimed ' Fargo and thinking it was nothing more than average , I was wandering if it would be a good idea to rent another Coen ' masterpiece ' . This time I was much less disappointed than I was with Fargo and I must say that most of the credit for that goes to the good jokes and the good acting of George Clooney . Well done Mr. Clooney , make more of these and less ' Perfect Stormish ' movies . You can act and you showed it here.7 out of 10 , " positive

" Just a regular Jason lee movie , There were some parts of the movie that were funny . The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess . These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties . It was an all right movie . It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention . I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot . Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie . This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central . I am glad that I didn 't see this movie in the theater , I would have been angry . But I guess that 's why I didn 't see it in the theater . , " negative
" I didn 't expect much from the movie so am not all that disappointed . Carrie looked ugly , Mr. Big had his eyebrows colored with crayons and Samantha didn 't say f * * * . Charlotte 's kid was annoying to watch as she was in too many scenes--the title could easily have been " " SATC : Parents ' Night Out . " " Camera angles just weren 't that good , especially regarding Carrie 's face . There was a token black woman thrown in whose character doesn 't have a proper exit and too few appearances by the gay men friends who seemed thrown in with no purpose anyway . Samantha 's going back and forth from LA choked the story flow , especially when she comes in for Fashion Week and nothing happens . The movie seems to have been made in rush because it could have been good but scenes were just thrown in to show different outfits or to offer viewers a chance to jump back in the show without adding much to the story of the movie . , " negative

" This was something I had been looking forward to seeing . The Ultimate Avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since Iron Man has been one of my favorite Marvel characters I thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an Iron Man solo title . But the final film was unsatisfying . I wasn 't expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to Iron Man gray armor . The red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together . Not a major complaint but not what I expected from the ads and box . The worse thing however was the story , the acting and the cell-shaded CGI animation for the monsters and Iron Man armor that was not convincing . It didn 't blend in well with the cell animation at all . Even on it 's own it seem stick-like and lifeless . Tony Stark 's character arc , as incredibly slow as it takes , is so forced and unconvincing . I wanted to see this movie because I love Iron Man but after forcing myself through the film I wondered if they couldn 't have come up with something that had been as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies . , " negative
" A wonderful , free flowing , often lyrical film that whisks you along , ever smiling , even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way . One gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well . This is possibly Depardieu 's best performance , certainly his most natural . Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age . Miou-Miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play . Initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rant / romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges . In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect . , " positive
" I only watched this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and featured Claudio Cassinelli , an actor I like . I was certainly disappointed.The idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for TV ratings has been overdone with Rollerball , Logan 's Run , Blade Runner , and the new film , Death Race , which will certainly suck me in because it stars Jason Statham.This was just a bore for the most part . The " " Kill Bike " " action was ridiculous . The " " training " " was a snooze-fest . It just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone , including " " Dallas " " star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson.Pick one of the others mentioned and you 'll be better off . , " negative
" One of the better Vance films succeeds more on interesting plot and artful direction by none other than Michael Curtiz . This time around a generally hated financier is found dead - shot in the head - in his locked and bolted bedroom on the upper floor . Philo Vance , hearing of the situation while about to set off for Italy , decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is a murder and what everyone else is considering a suicide . William Powell is as affable a Philo Vance as you will find . He never seems to press and is always very smooth in what he says and does . Powell is aided by a host of very talented actors - some first-rate character actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece that hated her uncle , Ralph Morgan as the dead man 's secretary , Paul Cavanaugh as a rival dog fancier , Arthur Hohl as a mysterious butler , Helen Vinson as the next door kept blonde , and two really good performances by James Lee as the Chinese cook and portly Eugene Palette as a wise-cracking police detective . Add into the mix a wonderfully comedic turn by Etienne Girardot as a public coroner always missing his meal . It is this depth of suspects and a story that has many plots twists and turns that make The Kennel Murder Case a fast-moving , fun mystery . , " positive
" The American Humane Association , which is the source of the familiar disclaimer " " No animals were harmed ... " " ( the registered trademark of the AHA ) , began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago , after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film Jesse James ( 1939 ) . Needless to say , the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me . I suppose one could say that at least the horse didn 't die in vain , since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making , but I can 't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice , this sure wouldn 't have been the path he would have taken ! , " negative
" Warning : Herzog is a filmaker , and as such tends to be a bit overly dramatic . So obsessions about closing doors may or may not be a real part of the character 's life , but a filmaker 's dramatic embellishment - or so both agreed at the premiere in San Francisco . But Herzog 's usual fascination with character , dreams and perseverance are well suited by this story first published in Soldier of Fortune , and now a full length autobiographical book . ( The Soldier of Fortune comment brought loud boos from the politically correct SF audience , and both filmaker and main character had to ensure the audience who had just seen the film , that SOF 's interest was misplaced - so warning , this is not Rambo , just survival . ) , " positive
" The Three Stooges in a feature length western comedy-musical ? Perhaps " " Rockin ' in the Rockies " " was meant to combine the Stooges comedy short with the western musical , in a matin챕e ; if so , this was a pleasant way to break up a Saturday afternoon . Jay Kirby ( as Rusty ) is a handsome young hero ; and , Mary Beth Hughes ( as the blonde June ) and Gladys Blake ( as the brunette Betty ) are pretty women . The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group ; their songs are quite tuneful ; however , this is the 1940s , not the 1950s , so the film doesn 't exactly " " rock " .

" This film stars Peter Lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who immigrates to America . Unfortunately , shortly after his arrival , he 's in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned . Because he looks so awful , no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation , he resorts to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness . Where exactly the film goes from there , you 'll just need to see for yourself.I scored this movie an 8 because , for the money spent to make it , it 's a heck of a good film with a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting . The film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film , but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises . In addition , the excellent acting by Lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles . This is an excellent film and delivers more than most " " A-pictures " " of the day . , " positive
" I couldn 't believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player . I thought I 'd have a good laugh , since I 've played D & D for half my life . I had to turn it off as I had company and they were wondering what the crap I was watching.Finished it later , and I should have just left it off at the soft-core gay clown porn in the beginning . No , they run the gamut of fart jokes , cum jokes , incest , racism , dressing up as KKK ...

" I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King 's book , the one this movie was based on . After reading this excellent work , I could not wait to see the movie version of it . After viewing the movie , I was TOTALLY disappointed . The only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters . In the book , Schwarzenegger 's character is put on a game show . The main object is to survive . But he 's not in an arena . He 's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show 's ( I guess you 'd call them ) villians , who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters . This premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax . The movie was absolute garbage . There was no cinematic quality to it .

" This movie , although well shot and superbly acted , was awful . I felt as if I was watching a car accident--sure I kept watching but I really wanted to turn my head . The plot leaves little to be desired , was extremely disjointed , and the ending was abysmal . Although , it did fit the tone of the movie , I was hoping for something to improve this movie . I still don 't understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie . Fifteen minutes of plot that really didn 't do much . It 's really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasted on such an awful , awful , story . There 's not much more to say about this movie .

" This was the worst movie I have ever seen . I have to admit I didn 't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining.The ' star ' was the most unpleasant character I 've ever seen , neither funny nor attractive , in fact , creepy and obnoxious are far too complimentary.It is painful to watch , there is no acting , especially not from the star who behaves as a doped up mentally deficient take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors.As horrible as it is to watch one of those can 't shut up black actors , watching a Puerto Rican one is even worse .

" Usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn 't have a lower rating , and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating . This is not the case here.Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0 / 10 film . It does nothing right and it doesn 't have the chance to because it doesn 't really attempt to do anything . There are strands of a bad D & D novel kind of plot which doesn 't hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout . It is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort , because even a completely patently untalented persons ' hard work would amount to more .

" Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the ' normal ' way , once with the scenes in consecutive order ( in this doozy of a film noir , the beginning , middle and end of the story intertwine ) , and once with the director 's commentary running . Quite amazing . A bare-bones tale , told with more flair , energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today . I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento , which turned me on to Nolan in the first place . Can 't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget ( and bigger box-office stars ) in his next film , Insomnia . , " positive
" There is an endless supply of trashy horror movies . It seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and thrill . Alas , very seldom these attempts succeed . This , unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value . The story is highly predictable , most of the actors very uninspired , or just plainly miscast , special effects of very low quality . It took a lot of effort not to switch off the DVD and go to bed . With such a limited number of foreign movies issued in the USA , why in the world would anybody want to import this drivel .

" " " Mad Dog Time " ... " " " Trigger Happy " " whatever you wanna call it ... simply doesn 't hit the mark .

The Rick , Mick , Vic Thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch . There wasn 't enough Changes of Location or Feel for the period they were supposed to be in . The Majority of the film was either set in " " Dreyfus 's Club " " or a variety of Offices / dim rooms ... ( what was with that Sit down Gun stand off thing Goldblum kept winning ? ) The supporting cast was ... on Paper excellent ( great to see Silva & Drago ) but characters were killed off before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors cameo was a Joke !

" In my years of attending film festivals , I have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution , and they end up in the $ 3 bins at WalMart . I just found DVD of Yank Tanks there , great doc , but how sad for it to end up as a rock-bottom remainder.I loved this film , wish I 'd seen it at the cinema in it 's everything . I 'd have preferred that New Yorker Films had translated the title directly . It 's good for Americans to stretch a little . If the film 's title helps the US audience to explore random chaos , all the better . Cinema imitates life & visa versa.Also , I found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars . Come on ! The euro is not hard to figure out , make the gringo audiences do the math . Seeing a film , especially one shot in Paris , the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded : I am an American watching a movie and they are translating the Euros into dollars for me .

Ummm .. it was kind of bloody , had likeable , shallow characters , and it had some really hot babes in it .

" For all losers who gave it negative review , its because you probably have sex once in 2 years , or you are in LTR with one girl for years . And guess what ? She is going to cheat on you when player like those on that show approach her somewhere.Off course any male who is not as good as these guys are going to hate them and hate the show . And that one chick who thinks this show is meant to mock these guys .. its more actually how to show clueless man how to pick up woman.What these guys are doing it way better then what most man are doing-not approaching at all.For anybody who has open mind I recommend to read the book " " the game " " by neil strauss.It deals with similar theme as this show , " positive
" I caught " " Sorrows Lost " " at the New York Film and Video Festival and I guess I had some high hopes for this film . Sadly , this is just another Visual FX calling card . The story is pretty lame . The bad lighting and camera work , along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low quality.Is it really too much to ask that FX shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the FX ! You can 't just get away with cool FX in shorts anymore , it 's been 5 years since " " 405 " " made a big splash . At least that short quick , cool and was even a little funny ! None of that can be said about " " Sorrows Lost . " " , " negative
" I also viewed this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival . It was an excellent film about adult family relationships . Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities to his family . It was funny , warm , poignant , and moving , as well as entertaining . A film like this would do very well with the word of mouth reviews . I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film . Let 's only hope they 'll have the chance . I would rate this film as one of the best movies I 've seen in a year . It contains no violence , action scenes , murders , sex , so evidently distributors question whether or not to pick it up . Believe me , there are people out there who would love to go see a movie like this that has redeeming value , instead of the many typical big box office blockbusters we are usually given . , " positive
" The French Naudet brothers did something nobody else did , they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened . They were in Building # 2 , when you could see papers drifting down , people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height.I mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running , their camera was still running , when the white dust covered them , they found a shop doorway and got inside , but all this footage is real and I think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us.Ten stars goes to the Naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that I watch every 9 / 11 so I 'll never forget what this country went through . I believe if I remember right , it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters , while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral . , " positive
" For those unfamiliar with Paddy Chayefsky , this is a very good introduction . While Chayefsky deals with the reality behind the myths of many things including medicine , this work is surprisingly prophetic of the way medicine is going today , two decades after the movie was made and over a decade after his death . Beyond that , some insights into Chayefsky 's view of life in general are ' slipped into ' the movie as well . The 20th Century may well turn out to be the first and last century of the United States in the History of the World . If it turns out that the contribution to the arts by the United States was in the dimension of the ' movie , ' this is a prime example of that art . , " positive
" Well this is a typical " " straight to the toilet " " slasher film.Long story short , a bunch of teenagers / young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons.This movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage : -Naked women , -teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky , -gory death scenes , -the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff , but never bra less , -a creepy , crazy man who knows about the evil , -lesbian kiss scene , -sex being a killer , -no plotEven then for a cheesy slasher film , it was really terrible . The atmosphere is totally dead . Nothing , not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity , was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested . Watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold.Give the demonic ..... 0 / 10 . , " negative
" A very credible and unsettling movie portraying the effects of war on the general public , Shame gives us a chilling understanding oh Ingmar Bergman 's beliefs . The absence of color and sound ( as in a soundtrack ) helps to give the film a more realistic feeling . There is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect . Everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality . At times the storyline was confusing , but perhaps in order to give a sense of the characters ' frame of mind 혯 how they too do now know what is happening or why . The simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring , but I could understand how the director is trying not to glamorize the story and points . He depicted the harsh and unsettling events and effects of war . In the beginning the characters were introduced and shown as content with the lighter settings and very long , drawn-out shots . When all of a sudden the war struck upon them , they were much darker and quiet with less intimate shots . Bergman did a good job on allowing us to be consumed by the war ourselves and presenting an image of it the so adequately corresponded to war . Although the storyline itself was not too impressive , the content of the film was . , " positive
" I almost didn 't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways.I thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked . The only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station.They were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy . It ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary.The rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be . The make-up was good and I have seen way worse movies then this one . It was a simple story with believable acting.It 's not the scariest or goriest movie , but I wasn 't ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it . On the DVD there was previews of other movies that all look good and i 'm gonna check them out . , " positive
" Frankly , after Cotton club and Unfaithful , it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film , because it is BAD . The acting was bad , the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere . It was well shot , but , then again , it is a big budget movie . It was too predictable , even for a chick flick . I even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end , the only thing I didn 't know was how . Too politically correct . Very disappointing . The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house , because it is beautiful . But , if you want that , watch National geographic . I love Lane , but I 've never seen her in a movie this lousy . As far as Gere goes , he 's a good actor , but he had movies like this , so I 'm not surprised . An hour and a half I wish I could bring back . , " negative
" This is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible . Obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny . What is it with the talking car with buttons that say Wendy 's , McDonalds , M & M 's and Skittles ? There was no talking car in the cartoon . ( Dr. ) Claw is supposed to be evil , not handsome and charming . Why is Rupert Everet ' Claw ' anyway ? Were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes ? It looks like they were ( badly ) lampooning Robo Cop , with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing . I tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie , you don 't get a refund . I 'm sorry I watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap . After I was told the no-refund policy , I decided to watch the rest of the hideous garbage called Inspector Gadget . , " negative
" As a " " rebuttle " " of sorts to the AFI 's top 100 films , the British Film Institute worked out a documentary with Martin Scorsese.Now. I am a huge film fan and pride myself on having seen many , many films . But , I am nowheres in comparrison with my idol . In this fantastic ( though long ) documentary , Scorsese walks the viewer through several stages of the American History on film . This is divided in to several sections including the Western , the Gangster film and the Noir . Full of bouncy enthusiasm , Martin Scorsese is a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor . , " positive
" I enjoyed Carax 's " " Les Amants du Pont Neuf " " and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard .

" I thought it was weird and just gory , not scary . I have seen a couple of the Japanese horror films , Ringu and Juon , and loved them ; but this movie was a disappointment . It never even explained anything about the curse . I just didn 't see any horror ... it wasn 't scary to me at all . The whole time I was watching I was waiting for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now . If this was some ancient curse , why didn 't it happen before Shuichi 's father ? And it never told us what happened to her father . I kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it just ended . I was very disappointed . , " negative
" I saw this movie about a year ago , and found it to be completely Laugh-Out-Loud funny . A real winner , in my mind . It had the underlining of a stupid comedy , but indeed had an actual plot as well . Much like the hit comedy , Elf , in fact . It had a few serious moments , sandwiched between hilarity . When Stiller shot Black 's horse , an ordinarily sober moment , you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antics . You can actually find common ground there , as I 'm sure many people have done something they wouldn 't want a friend to find out about , lest your friendship should end.When I found out how much people disliked this movie , I was completely dumbfounded . That absolutely terrible movies like Napoleon Dynamite had ratings higher than it makes me wonder about the sanity of people on IMDb . Take my advice and rent it . If you don 't find yourself laughing at least once , I 'll compensate you the rental fee . = D , " positive
" Henry Fool is a better film . But this is the perfect way to follow-up a film like ' Henry Fool . ' To take Henry very seriously , his ' lies ' and his mysterious aura . Even the opening shot of ' Henry Fool ' when Simon puts his ear to the ground as Henry comes walking over the hill is more fully manifest through ' Fay Grim . ' The over-the-top jokes , that are more or less meta-jokes ( about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves ) , are good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them . Also Hartley 's use of Dutch angles throughout the film is jarring , yes , it 's intention , but it feels forced and over-used , it goes beyond jarring to , what I 'd like to call , annoying . It 's a flawed film , but a must see for any Hartley or ' Henry Fool ' fan . And don 't listen to stupid reviews , don 't watch this unless you 've seen the first film . The intrigue , satire and wit of this movie is totally lost if you haven 't seen Henry Fool . It 's a sequel . That 's just dumb . , " positive
" Hollywood does it again . Lots of money , no creativity . I 'm sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this one .

Why waste your time . You can sit on a log doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide . , " negative
" I should have trusted my instincts better : No expectations - no disappointments . Instead , however , I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi ( 1983 ) and was brutally disappointed . Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor , and - artistically - it fails miserably . It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi , hurriedly threw it together , placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music , which is incessantly repeated . Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes , Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow-motion ( if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode , you 'll see what I mean ) . What disappointed me the most , however , was Philip Glass 's soundtrack . I couldn 't - and still can 't - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age type drones , which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a Casio calculator , were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi . All in all , a big waste of time ! My advice : Forget commercialism ! Watch Koyaanisqatsi again instead ! , " negative
" This film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad . The premise was O.K , but the plot itself was terrible . The actors tried their best with limited material , but they could not rise above the mean spiritedness of this tacky college film . Jason Schwartzman was once again immensely irritating - even more so than in Rushmore , the rest of the cast were quite non-eventful . Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off-putting & incredibly juvenile . Tries to be a Road Trip / American Pie but fails dismally on all levels . A total waste of everyone 's time . , " negative
" Not a terrible film -- my 10 year old boy loved it , and he would be the target demographic , so I guess they hit the spot . Pretty dull for an adult though.Hard to relate to animated lego characters , even mod high-tech ones.I thought the choice of the three great virtues of the Bionicle world was a bit odd -- unity , duty , and destiny . Am I the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic ? Especially destiny . What about freedom , equality , justice , etc . ? Oh well , it will sell Lego . Kind of dull for a movie , but not bad for a 74-minute advertisement . Could have been a lot worse . , " negative
" This is definitely a " " lesser known " " comedy short from the 1920s . The only reason I saw it was because it was on a DVD by Kino Films featuring non-Laurel and Hardy shorts featuring Ollie . They are interesting and historically important , but also generally average to below average for the style film . Compared to shorts by Chaplin , Keaton , Arbuckle and Lloyd , they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor . Also , the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent DVDs . I ended up turning OFF the sound due to the inappropriateness of the music to set the proper mood . But , despite this , they are still worth seeing.I 've gotta be honest about this short . It was the last of 8 on this DVD and by the time I got to it , I was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts . So , it is possible the film might be A LITTLE better than a 4--but certainly , if this is the case , no better than a 5 ! The film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy . Nothing especially interesting and there are certainly MUCH better silent shorts out there . , " negative
" The two things are are good about this film are it 's two unknown celebrities.First , Daphne Zuniga , in her first appearance in a film , young and supple , with looks that still encompass her body today , steals the very beginning , which is all she is in , and that is that . She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects.Second , the score by then known composer Christopher ( Chris ) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star ... yeah , I know one star more is not much , but in this movie 's case , it is a lot.The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down , getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer , blah , blah , blah ... we all know where this is going.Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga , then turn it off . , " negative

The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this ! Check out the hysterical scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and effects they do to try and show how badly Pia 's character is freaking out . Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this . Pia Zadora as a screenwriter ? Yeah , right . Pia can barely talk , let alone write ! Pia is utterly and absolutely miscast in this dumb role .

So this was not the best time to watch a mediocre Gay flick.The story was silly and the acting was OK . It was not bad enough to turn off , but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotyping . It was not very well cast either.Would I recommend this movie ? No you would be wasting your time and money . I don 't understand why movies like these are made and who is funding them . Spend your time Watching Noah 's Arc on Logo instead .

" The movie is basically a boring string of appalling clich챕s which do not offer a real cross-cultural insight . The Middle Eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way : there obviously are mud brick villages , dirt tracks in the middle of the desert , women clad in black robes and belly dancers . I wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture . The personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible . The original idea might have been interesting , but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight , you should skip this movie . , " negative

" This is a formula B science fiction movie , and the director made no bones about it . It is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team . Everything done is stuff you 've seen many times before . It is a weak script , with no real characters . In fact , it is full of stereotype characters and situations . The director attacks this by just making it a formula movie , with no attempt to fool us , and that gives this movie a mild appeal , but it isn 't something you 're likely to remember a while . It is best seen while you 're cooking , cleaning , working out . Sort of mindless fun . It has its place in entertainment , but it certainly isn 't something you sit down with friends to watch , unless you 're all just drunk and don 't care . The mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair . I don 't think it is as crappy as most people , but I am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular .

" This is an excellent but hard to find trippy World War I spy thriller in the inimitable 60 's Italian style . From the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene with Capucine and the elaborately produced apocalyptic no man 's land battle scenes with poison gas and German cavalry in full gas proof ' storm trooper ' gear , this is a movie that should not be missed . It is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield . Apart from the battle scenes , some of the production and special effects are primitive , apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes , but for lovers of 60 's cinema it should not be an issue . I first saw this movie on television many years ago and had the foresight to tape it on VHS . I still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time . , " positive

The use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural .

" Well it certainly stunned me - I can not believe that someone made another Australian film that 's even more boring than Somersault . The story is implausible , the characters , with the exception of Friels ' and Mailman 's characters , are unlikeable and wooden , Tom Long possesses a VAST array of facial expressions : happy and not happy , and the " " sex scenes " , " which could have been very confronting and disturbingly erotic , would have been at home in a low-budget porno flick.This is the first movie I have seen in 30 years of cinema-going that has had me on the edge of my seat .... ready to get up and leave.The best thing about this movie is the promotional poster . , " negative

" I had my reservations about watching The Return to Lonesome Dove after seeing and enjoying the original so much . Without Tommy Lee Jones reprising his role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara , I figured it just wouldn 't seem authentic enough . Upon viewing ' return ' I can honestly say it 's a worthy successor . The actors really make the show with Jon Voight , Rick Schroder , and Oliver Reed all preforming at their very best . I admit the story might not be quite as engrossing as the first , but ' return ' definitely has it 's share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have . Anyone who still has reservations can rest assured that The Return to Lonesome Dove succeeds in capturing the ' feel ' of the original and will not disappoint .

" Trite and unoriginal . It 's like someone watched Immortal Beloved and Amadeus and decided to mix them together and , in the process , steal other formulaic plot parts from other movies to make another one . As with most historical movies nowadays , there are some inaccuracies as history is manipulated to better suit the story , which is understandable for the most part . For example , during the remaining days of Beethoven 's life , it was necessary for other people to write down what they needed to say in order for him to understand them . That , of course , would have been a nuisance to have to show on screen . The script , although filled with some quotable lines , doesn 't quite capture the feel of that time period and , coupled with some bad acting , seems rather contemporary . Diane Kruger is nice enough to look at but she still has lots to improve on her craft . Ed Harris doesn 't work for me as Beethoven and I mostly blame Gary Oldman for that . Overall , not a very good interpretation of the musical maestro 's life . Better just find yourself a copy of Immortal Beloved.http : / / iwascalledclementine.multiply.com / reviews , " negative
" Takashi Miike 's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements . This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark . Even as a kid , I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales ; horrible things happen to people in most children 's books . Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier ( and more disturbing ) than what they appear to be at first glance . The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom . He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions . Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids . I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers . He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain . But a self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers . I thought it was a great film . Highly recommended . , " positive
" One reasons why they call the 80 's , " " The Awesome 80 's " " is quality television . Shows like the Wonder Years , War of the Worlds ( the series ) , V , Amazing Stories , and many more have always left an impression to each " " fortunate " " one of us that in time will always find a way to reawaken itself . To top that , here comes Monsters ! A series quite unique of its own , and a theme fully dedicate to - monsters . May it be the good , the bad , and the morbid.If you 're a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you .

In the final scenes , there is a trial held by the reform school boys with flaming torches and a barn which is set on fire and a big leap by the corrupt warden .

Notice that there are only a couple of people who get ' cured ' while we see quite a few cases.Keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest Indian bank note is 5 rupee , while the average salary in India is 1,700 ru / month . , " negative
" The Color Purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life . Every character had an element of the color purple in them . The movie touches on love , lost , hope , hate , and triumph. whether it be Celie having lived through hell and losing her sister , and Shug coming into her life to show her love again , Albert not being man righting his wrong toward Celie , Shug shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end , Sofia and her stubborness good and bad , and even Nettie , they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and that 's the sign of a good movie . Good Job to all the cast and crew . , " positive
" Dudley Moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic . This film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent . Without Dudley Moore , John Gielgud , Liza Minnelli , and a few others , this film could have been a disaster . It is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood ( the " " psycho " " -like music at the wedding fight ) , but the acting overcomes it . The character Arthur is hilarious , with his drunken comments . But he develops well into a more mature , well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will . The end is fairly corny , though . I wont give it away , but it could be improved . Worth seeing many times . , " positive
" Although I didn 't like Stanley & Iris tremendously as a film , I did admire the acting . Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie . I haven 't always been a fan of Fonda 's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time . De Niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold . He gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can 't care for him anymore that will break your heart . I wouldn 't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment , but I will say you won 't see much bette acting anywhere . , " positive
" If you are planning to watch ' Partner ' and are on IMDb reading reviews about it , you have already wasted too much time over this stupid , idiotic , awful movie.It 's a horrible , horrible , horrible copy of the movie ' Hitch . ' I choose to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews I had heard about this movie , and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it - I thought that after all its David Dhawan who is making it , and it has Govinda - how bad can it be ? But after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense , I couldn 't take it any more , and turned off my computer.Overacting by everyone in the movie , stupid dialogues , total time waste - I gave it a 1-star rating because that 's the lowest you can do . If I could go lower , I would have given it a -100 rating . , " negative
" This is one of the best action films I have seen . Geena 's portrayal of the tough as nails , ' Charly ' / gentle mother ' Sam ' , was superb and Samuel L Jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through , with his classic one liners . Sure , there were a few holes in the actual story , but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.I felt Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam / Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie ' Stuart Little ' . Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse , Brian Cox , sweet little Yvonne Zima and newcomers , sexy Craig Bierko , and Melina Kanakaredes . This film accentuates the growing trend of strong female character and the diversion away from traditional male / female stereotypes as we see Sam / Charly ( Davis ) and Mitch ( Jackson ) hurtling from one disaster to the next.While I and many others loved this movie , it is fair to say that there will always be people that don 't and that 's fine - each , to their own . I highly recommend this film to action fans , for its hilarious scenes and fast-paced action . , " positive

" I recently stumbled across a TV showing of " " Passion .... " " ( having missed the opening scenes ) . Ms Currier in to be praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a strange de Balzac tale to the screen . I am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their parts in producing such a thoroughly fine motion picture . It must have been arduous shooting so many scenes in the desert . And I cannot comprehend how her trainer coaxed such a fine " " performance " " from the leopard , Simoon . ( This adverture calls to mind another suspenseful adventure , " " Naked Prey " " ) . Why isn 't this film more well-known ? . Hope I can find it on video . , " positive
" So-so thriller starring Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis , who join David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes on a road trip out west . The latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book ; Pitt 's a serial killer on the lam ( unbeknownst to Dave ) and Juliette is his poor , not-all-there companion . This is a good cast and the story moves along , but Pitt isn 't belivably scary as a serial killer , although it is one of his better earlier roles . The best thing is here is Michelle Forbes , who always manages to shine , whether in her roles on ' Homicide : Life on the Street ' or in the brief series ' Wonderland . ' Vote : 6 , " positive
" Devil 's Experiment : 1 / 10 : Hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot ( Gee that is one lucky pizza boy ) and those without ( Anal Amateurs 36 ) . Devil 's Experiment falls solidly into the latter category . It is of course the horror version of hardcore porn . An almost completely plot less 43-minute wait for the money shot . Shot on video in 1985 it consists of three relatively non-descript Japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive Japanese girl . The tortures range from the banal ( slapping her 50 times , kicking her a hundred ) , the silly ( tying her to an office chair and spinning her around ) , the fear factor ( a bath of maggots and sheep guts ) and finally the money shot . ( A well executed eyeball piercing ) . That 's it , no plot , no motive , just Blair Witch tree shots and torture . The girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling , " " no one expects the Spanish Inquisition " " during the office chair scene I was bored silly . Staring dumbfounded at the screen , waiting for the money shot . Just like hardcore porn . , " negative
" I absolutely love this show , but I saw the second episode first . After watching the first episode I could see why people were turned off at first . The first episode 's humor is not the best , and they struggle to properly start the series . However , I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show . The characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters . As a first episode , it really doesn 't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good . The episode is not bad by any means , but as the show progresses it becomes better and better , so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show . , " positive
I have never watched a movie that frustrated me more than Lord Of The Dance . Frustrated because it could have been fantastic . Frustrated because the dancing might have been astounding . Frustrated because the women could have been gorgeous . How would I know though ? ! By the time your eyes have moved to the area of interest on the screen and focused appropriately on the spot to be admired the insane editor has moved the shot ! I completely agree with the other comments here about the crappy lighting and terrible camera / editor work . It makes me nauseous just watching ten minutes of this would be spectacular movie.Give me an opportunity to get a front seat to the live concert and I would be there in a shot ! Nicholas T , negative
" I have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the first.It was awful . I actually didn 't watch the end of it . It was like watching a boring soap or a really good one ( all soaps are crap ) . The actors were poor and storyline was bad . The person who rated it 10 / 10 has no idea what he is on about . The script was awful . 2 People was in an angry conversation together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no . He says " " If you do that ... I will hurt you " " Hahahahaha . If comedy is your thing , watch away . Please do not watch this film because ... It 's CRAP ! ! ! Summary : Poor acting , bad fights , bad script.Don 't watch ! Of course this is in my opinion . , " negative
" " " Broken Bow " " takes us back to where it all began . Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk , Spock and McCoy . This installment of the " " Star Trek " " franchise , is in my opinion the first series since " " TOS " " to recapture the feelings of wonder , danger and excitement of " " Going Where No Man Has Gone Before " . " Scott Bakula is perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer , the first Captain of the first " " Star Ship Enterprise " . " He and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the Star Trek legacy . John Billingsley is Brilliant as the alien Dr. Phlox , and Jolene Blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical Vulcan science officer T 'Pol . Broken Bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the Treks , and I believe Gene Roddenberry would surely be proud . , " positive
" The old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in " " Women in Love . " " The script , taken from D. H. Lawrence 's novel , contains an endless flow of concepts that are , at best , sophomoric.What a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise ; what an empty array of characters given such attention . In spite of high production values , this film comes across as tedious as its personnel.A revisit in 2001 merely confirms a 1969 impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies , dawdling nowhere , and fumbling every step of the way . , " negative
" I love comedies and I love independent films , but this was much too slow and the humor was extremely regional . I guess It would have been better if the main characters were likeable , but they were just typical gen-x slacker types , just like the people that have been causing trouble in high schools for forty years ... I can understand High Praise for a young indie film-maker when it is deserving , but this is an extremely average film . , " negative
" The reason the DVD releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public domain film , a modest sea story at best.Distributed for television thru Allied Artists , DVD 's ( or VHS ) on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same 16MM television print . Films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b / w prints , because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway . Striking b / w prints for television was also cheaper , as it often involved quite a few prints to cover all stations running a film on a syndicated basis . , " negative
" Du rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film which studies criminal minds and allows viewers to have a better understanding of criminals who are fundamentally not different from ordinary folks like us.What director Jules Dassin shows is that criminal do have families and they care a lot for them.That is why they adhere to a strict code of honor . For them a family is not only made up of wives , mistresses and children but also include casual acquaintances and close friends.Contrary to what many might find it hard to believe , Jules Dassin has not tried to glorify crime in his film as rififi makes it clear that crime never pays.It shows that all kinds of bad activities result in some kind of human loss.Apart from its philosophical stance Rifif is worth watching for its technical finesse.While watching one of the film 's most brilliant sequences about breaking of a safe , one would find it hard to believe meticulous precision with which criminal minds execute their plans.This is a scene which nobody has dared to copy in Hollywood . , " positive
" I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie . It 's April 8 , 1994 , each of the characters are in their " " mid 20 's " " and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition ( acting , music , film , writing ) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain 's suicide . They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil . It 's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes . Highlights include : a visit to Jimi Hendirx 's grave , Kurt Cobain 's original childhood home and a campfire sing along . An honest an original piece of work . , " positive
" Great movie ! oh yeah ! Full of energy , full of fun , presenting our generation , our alienation : a hymn to positive thinking despite this world we live in , a tale of a great party , a tale of a bunch of friends who desperately must do something in a week end and the only thing to do is The Club . But fun and extasy keep boredom away ! Very funny , nicely grotesque in a few points , nicely shot ... and great soundtrack ! , " positive
" Saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970 's and hated , hated , hated it ! Easily the most booooring movie I have ever seen in my life . Don 't know where Leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate . The title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie , just long , long silences with people unable to articulate what they are ( presumably ) feeling . If you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you . If you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster : the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this ! Yes , Leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss . , " negative
" Personally I 've watched it because of Lea Thompson 's appearance and I didn 't really expect to enjoy the movie as such , but surprisingly I kept watching it until the end.Let 's face it - it just one of the saga-like stories and isn 't particularly original or entertaining , but strangely it just keeps you by the TV . My opinion about Will of Their Own would be much better if there wouldn 't be one point that I just don 't get.There is lovely and really touchy scene in which Lea Thompson 's character is running on the street holding baby in her arms , the snow is falling , she is cold , scared , and has no place to stay , she doesn 't know what to do next . And then about 10-12 years later , when things are better for her , she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming about.I just don 't get it - I don 't see how is it possible that she would do such thing , it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival . After this character flip I just couldn 't enjoy rest of the movie . , " negative
" This film had my heart pounding . The acting was great , the erotic music and the beautiful women add up to make this one a winner .

" It 's getting worse , the series is on a serious down fall . The first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really , really terrible movies .

This time , the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of Alice 's unborn child . His intention is to be " " born again " " into the real world .

" This movie pleasantly surprised me . It has a touching , slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention . This is a movie I never heard about , but if you want a " " sleeper " , " this is it . Great writing , production , and acting . I highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful . Nick Nolte , Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are marvelous . Why wasn 't more made of this movie ? , " positive
" This has got to be the worst horror movie I have EVER seen.I hated it so much I wanted to come here and complain about how bad it was .

" When a friend and I saw this in the recent releases , we decided to get it despite the fact that neither of us had heard of it before . We both like Costas Mandylor and it had James Coburn so we figured it couldn 't be that bad . We were wrong . It was . It was REALLY that bad . No actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing . It was like taking Titanic , The Poseidon Adventure and some nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and paste it all together.I must admit that there were a couple of chuckles . I did laugh when the head cabin boy is asking Alan ( Costas Mandylor ) if he 's some " " pussy marine . " " The other laughs this film got though had nothing to do with the writing . I would dearly love to know how the people making this movie thought that you could have a cruise liner knocked upside down and have it remain steady . It isn 't tipped or anything.If you are looking for something to watch for Costas Mandylor , James Coburn or any of the rest of this cast , move on . Find something good that they did . , " negative
" i 've heard a lot about the inventive camera-work and direction in this movie. i thought both were a messalso some truly terrible acting. the main ' heroine ' in the movie is irritating beyond belief and has absolutely nothing useful to contribute in any situation. everything she does or says is stupid , and she generally just seems to mess peoples lives up. if she could fight , i might forgive heroverall all the women in this movie are stereotypical ' broads ' in need of a man to save them. and all the men in this movie are muscle bound dim wits capable of saving no onethis is a poor movie , and i urge you to avoid it. watch something like ' the sword of doom ' instead , i hear its much better than this confusing mess of a film . , " negative
" Where do I start ? Per the title of this film I expected some degree of authenticity , in the end I was severally let down . This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene , rather it is a Hollywood ( or pick your film making hub ) story loosely based on some real life characters . I should have had a clue when I heard a heavy English accent giving the intro to the movie in German ; the blood red text ( title , artists ) should have been the 2nd clue . The story line is contrived ( Lale was not tricked out of Switzerland Rolf Liebermann 's parents , there is no info that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany , the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the NS regime not while under control , the record played at the station was picked up in Vienna while a Lt. was there on leave , etc , etc ) the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames ( SS black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions , these went away from daily use once the war started , etc ) , the characters are stereo types ( SA bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power ) . Don 't waste your time . , " negative
" First I have to admit that I have had some doubts about the director . He has done some movies ( with Jarkovsky ) about the recent " " czech = east " " history or more precisely about families ( individuals ) how did they survive some historical moments . But it was always like the chines food sour-sweet . This movie was totally different . It was pure , it shows the bones of life , it shows the variations of human natures . This film is an excellent piece of art ( story , acting , picture , music ) but it shows you the life around you in much brighter light that we don 't want to see . By the way I have saw it on a DVD ( with English subtitles ) but I am afraid that in the USA I wont be able to get it . , " positive
" I really didn 't like this film . The plot was very predictable . Typical American plot , I 'm sorry . Guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end . And London has a Monorail ? Bank of London ? ? ? Bank of England is what it really is ! ! - I did however like the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves . And the Brits were baddies ? ( apart from Parker and Lady Penelope ) What was up with that ? Oh and they kept on saying stuff like " " Here come ' The Thunderbirds ' " " - but it was never known as ' The Thunderbirds ' in the series , why do that ? ? I 'd like to see this re-made in 20 years with more British cast . I preferred the original series . Sorry ! , " negative
" This movie is the funniest danish movie I 've ever seen ! The plot is funny , surprising and exceptionel . Danish humor is unlike any other , and it gets you every time .

" The Railway Children is perhaps my favorite film of all time simply for the brilliant acting of the cast , the warm , humane interaction of the 3 children and the people they encounter living near the railway in the beautiful English countryside . Jenny Augutter is especially believable in her role as ' Bobbie ' the older sibling of her sister Phyllis and brother Peter.The adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinating.The scenery is lovely , the trains a part of Britain 's vast history and the soundtrack is very moving . This heartwarming film never fails to bring tears to my eyes , each and every time as well as makes me homesick.I often wonder if I should have been born in that era as I think I would have fitted in just fine as people treated each other with such chivalry and decency.In short I consider this film somewhat of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a ' sensitive or caring type ' .Edith Nesbit wrote this story around the beginning of the 1900 's and what a wonderful story it is.More kids today need to read this or see the film instead of playing violent video games.If we had more films of this nature , the world would become a better place . , " positive
" OMG this was the most painful experience of my life watching this . I could even finish it what is happening to Nick .

" When you 're making a thriller about witchcraft , I believe you should do everything you can to help the audience suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work . Some pictures ( " " Rosemary 's Baby " , " for example ) have accomplished this ; others ( like " " Necromancy " " ) haven 't and the potentially scary material comes across as corny and goofy . This film does have some atmospheric moments , but about half the dialogue is hard to make out ( sometimes it 's poorly recorded , at other times just incomprehensible ) and Orson Welles , who gets top billing , has a role that is so BENEATH him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work . Or maybe he was simply having fun ..... ( * 1 / 2 ) , " negative
" During my teens or should I say prime time I was " " eating up " " all kinds of SF novels every day of the week . It was in the Sixties and Seventies when TV was not such a important leisure time killer like today , one night in the mid seventies I watched the movie on TV I think it was ARD and I was stunned . I was impressed in a way that I can almost remember each scene even today.Nowadays I observe my kids playing the SIMS or something like that and I think we are close to what that Fassbender Movie expressed . I also would highly appreciate if I could buy this movie on a DVD . But in vain I tried almost everything to get a hint where . The movie MATRIX cannot touch by far the quality and the state of art of this movie . And by the way by now we do not have a glue if we were a superior reality or just one of a couple simulation models . Probably after our death we definitely will know ... , " positive
" Disappointing heist movie indeed , I was actually expecting a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff going on through out the movie and it does have few of those cat and mouse stuff going on , but it was just pretty stupid . And it basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer , as a matter of fact if you seen the trailer to this , you basically seen the whole film cause it is just that predictable . So basically the plot is about a few armored truck company workers that try to steal the 42 million dollars they are suppose to transport , until one of the members grows a conscience . I thought the movie would be better with it 's cast of well known actors , but I was wrong . I mean this isn 't necessarily a bad film but it just wasn 't that good either or has any depth . This is most definitely a rental at best , just not really worth seeing it in theaters. heist 4.8 / 10 , " negative
" Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney wasn 't in the role . Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES ? I mean , it 's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too , but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama . The boys work great with Garfield . A nice sequence was the whole " " swimming " " scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment : Claude Rains was grossly miscast . As the detective , the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse . , " positive
" The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history . This movie bored me . It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots . Here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them . It comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties . Mind you , she is torn between cultures and doesn 't have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real . She is listening to ever-so-many voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of Iran . The only thing I received from this movie was angst . , " negative
" A young girl surviving as a prostitute.A cheap hustler who wants to get the big score.They meet each other in Thailand . You may think by the opening titles it 's going to be a violent movie but it is also a story of love with two persons in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life . This film feels like an essay sometimes because of its changes of images , but still refreshing . This story is also about Eros and Thanatos . " " It 's not an original joke but it is well told " " says a character and that also applies to this one : We 've seen the story but this way we see it . Thailand appears in hot tones , the photograph going from one colored to a multicolored place . And it captures the city as the cage of this imperfect persons . There is also a good use of the music to dot the actions . , " positive
" Horrible ending - and I can 't believe Moore spent a year coming up with it . Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs , which Hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks . This was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3.5 years . Now , the first 1.5 hours were action packed , though absurd in the premise , and then it deteriorated into a slow , painful , sophomoric dissolution of the series . Unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was . Were we to think more deeply ? If I wanted a lesson in a-materialism , I would reread Daniel Quinn 's Ishmael . Absurd to think 38K people would give up everything for a " " fresh start " . " Absurd to throw in a disappearing Kara , and a reappearing Baltar and Six . Absurd to throw in the Mitochondrial Eve .

" The worst thing I have ever watch.The movie is pure trash . All the things is bad on this movie . The direction , screenplay , arts , cinematography , cast or anything else.May I say more ? The main character is an boy . It has to have 20 years of age approximately , but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years old , in addition he is an very bad actor.The editing tries to save it , but with that very bad material in hands they can 't do miracles.As I said , the cast is poor , the text is poor , that it doesn 't help the actors.I learned how to " " do not " " make a movie . , " negative
" BIG FAT LIAR , in my opinion , is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it . When Jason ( Frankie Muniz - " " MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE " " ) and Kaylee ( Amanda Bynes - " " ALL THAT " " ) played those tricks on Marty ( Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE ) , I really smiled and felt good . That 's what I liked most about this movie . As a matter of fact , everything that happened after Jason 's essay erroneously ended up in Marty 's hands was hilarious . I especially loved Jaleel White 's cameo . When I first saw him , I couldn 't be certain , but , when I asked my mother if it was him , she said , " " Of course ! " " Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say , " " Like I said earlier , there is a moral to this story , and that moral is , always tell the truth . " " Now , in conclusion , if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz , Amanda Bynes , or Paul Giamatti , I highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it . , " positive
" The premise of the movie had much going for it , however , despite the novelty of models selling off someone else 's furniture to live the high life , this movie has nothing going for it . The characters are cardboard . The dialog is so painfully scripted , it 's hard to sit through , and if there were any jokes in the movie , I missed them . Marilyn Monroe 's walking into walls because she doesn 't want to wear glasses is completely unbelievable & not funny . Grable 's stupidity is also too ham-fisted to be believed . Bacall 's gold-digging is so forced , it 's annoying to listen to . Why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me . , " negative
" Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who 's been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands . The doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that 'll return his lost memories if it works . But when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon , he chooses to escape instead . While outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather ( Greg Grunberg ) mistreats his mother , won 't let her near the darkroom in his basement & acts suspicious in general.While the general ' mystery ' of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it 's revealed , I found Mr. Diamond 's acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout . ( In the interest of full disclosure , I 've been a huge fan of his since Homicide and his brief , but extremely pivotal , role in The Shield up through Journeyman & Dollhouse ) Not a great film nor a good one , but serviceable enough . Although I did like it better than the previous films that I 've seen from Director / writer Michael Hurst ( Room 6 , Pumkinhead 4 , Mansquito ) Eye Candy : one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucinationMy Grade : C- , " negative
" This is by far the worst horror / thriller I 've seen in my 29 years . If someone offers this to you for free tell them NO . This movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it . The plot isn 't even the worst part of this movie ..... its the acting , camera work , lighting , and sound. there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. whoever paid to have this film made is broke now . I hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie . In its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual BTK killer 's capture but I 've seen movie of the weeks that looked like Oscar winners compared to this . , " negative
" Recovery is a well-judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that doesn 't sentimentalise the main characters . David Tennant and Sarah Parish bring to the fore the complex and conflicting emotions of a couple deeply in love struggling to come to terms with the personality changes they both endure and also must make to survive a tragic accident.Tennant , as Alan , brings humour as well as a dangerous lecherousness , as an engineer recovering from a memory loss brought on by a road accident . Alan is not portrayed simply as a victim but as human being with feelings doing the best he can to make sense of his new life . Sarah Parish 's Tricia is not a clich챕d stand-by-her-man housewife who will do anything to support her husband . She struggles with falling out of love with Alan , as the man she once new and loved is now a completely different person - a stranger to her.Contrary to some opinion , this - in my view - makes perfect Sunday night viewing . Too often , we are shown soft family dramas or detective series , like Heartbeat , which rot and putrefy the brain . Programme commissioners seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our minds go to sleep . More challenging and thought-provoking drama like Recovery would seriously change the situation . , " positive
Being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities I think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb.It 's your basic ' who done it ? ' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end . I like these kinds of movies and I certainly think this one meets the standard.To me it was worth watching more than once so I 'll give it an 8 on imdb . , positive
" I am no Ebert . What I am is a compassionate and I have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than I felt for Leland P. Fitzgerald . Sorry if I do not offer a critique , but I see nothing but perfection in this film . I am sure that many who watch this film will never see the same things I do , but if you look hard enough maybe you will see something you weren 't expecting . I 've read that the character of Leland was flawed . It seems to me that who wrote this was not able to see past the Question this movie presents . I feel sorry for anyone who doesn 't see the answers this movie delivers . Open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this Leland P. Fitzgerald show you a world that truly has a meaning . Excepcional story with extraordinary acting . Ryan Gosling deserves to be talked about . , " positive
" This is one of my all-time favorite films , and while it may move too slowly for some , it 's well worth seeing . A corporate lawyer ( Richard Chamberlain ) is dragged into a case involving " " city " " Aborigines , and this is no ordinary case . OK , a man has died but it wasn 't exactly a normal killing . There has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately , and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & oppressive . The Aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans . This has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about " " City " " vs. " " Tribal " " Aborigines , and of course no Abo in the big city would practice tribal ways . Uh huh . Chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what 's happening , although no matter how many times I 've seen this I can 't quite grasp the exact connection . This is a very eerie and creepy film , and is a fine example of Peter Weir 's ability to create tension out of nothing . The ending is a little ambiguous but I take it literally , it 's the easiest way out and the scariest . 10 out of 10 and highly recommended . , " positive
" I watched the DVD ( called BLACK WIDOW in the U.S.A. ) and felt afterward that it was , indeed , a truly awful movie . But they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film , or I missed a lot . The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity ( not even a breast ) , but I 've read several other comments on IMDb.com mentioning the vulgarity and something about a tampon . I did not see anything like that , just a bad , boring film with unlikable characters and a trite , sophomoric plot . Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or Botoxed to the gills , and nary an expression touches her face . And her name makes me think of super-sizing a beverage at Taco Bell : " " I 'll have the Cola Grande ! " " It was actually kind of fun it was so bad , I got to play like I was in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000 , noting things like the fact that Dafoe 's skin is too big for his face . It 's really like silly putty ! , " negative
" This movie is a disgrace to the Major League Franchise . I live in Minnesota and even I can 't believe they dumped Cleveland . ( Yes I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good , and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League , but still be consistent . ) Anyway I loved the first Major League , liked the second , and always looked forward to the third , when the Indians would finally go all the way to the series . You can 't tell me this wasn 't the plan after the second film was completed . What Happened ? Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and don 't watch this junk . , " negative
" A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending H-bomb blast . Not only do they fear the radiation , but also mutants in the surrounding hillside . One of the group is already contaminated , but strangely poses no real threat to the others . Just surviving the friction of assorted personalities at close range is the sub-plot . Richard Denning plays the hero . Mike Connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy . Lori Nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world . Not one of director Roger Corman 's best . This is predictable black and white sci-fi . , " negative
" This really doesn 't do the blues justice . It starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell ( or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson ? Someone blind anyway ) apparently narrating from outer space ( ? ) and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians . Corny as it is , this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary . Afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes , filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of Beck and Shemekia Copeland raping the same songs afterwards . This is a good device to show us why the old Blues greats were really so great , but it doesn 't make for compelling viewing . There is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play . Nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments . It 's a shame for Wenders , Scorsese and especially for the Blues . Avoid at all costs . , " negative
" Mad scientist Professor Tabani drinks a potion he has brewed up in his laboratory but is turned into a blood craving vampire instead.When Dr.Aqil pays a visit Tabani sees a picture of Aqil 's wife Shabnam and , after turning Aqil into a vampire , heads for Shabnam to make her his bride.Aqil 's brother discovers the grave of the vampire and his brother at Tabani 's castle and kills his brother with a knife to free his soul.Tabani succeeds in putting the bite on Shabnam and once turned she tries to lure her young niece away.Aqil 's brother races against time to put a stop to the vampire curse . " " Zinda Laash " " almost put me to sleep.The plot is extremely slow but more or less follows Bram Stoker 's famous novel.The suspense is completely absent as is the gore and nudity.The film is only recommended for curious horror fans that want to see the second horror film made in Pakistan ( after " " Madman " " from 1964 ) . , " negative
" This show is about three little girls . ( D.J , Stephanie , and Michelle ) Their Mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father Danny invites his Brother-in-law ( Jesse ) and his Old Friend ( Joey ) . So the whole show is about living life . The girls go through life 's troubles and have life lessons . They develop crushes , boyfriends , and many more . The whole show is basically about to go with the flow . You do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go . I think this show is really good and fun to watch . I grew up watching this show and still watch it today . I am glad they still air this show on television . I watch it almost every day . I rate it 10 / 10 . , " positive
" A movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun , romantic and easy-going entertainment . Instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed , so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all , even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable . SPOILER --When the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen ( Danner and McEwan ) , you know you 're in trouble . But those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine people.END OF SPOILERCapshaw is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely successful . Like I said above , the theme seems to be repression and I understand that is an element of life and love but I don 't want to see a movie about it either , at least not this one . I can 't recommend this at all , despite the very talented cast who are left to fend for themselves . , " negative
" Based on Elmore Leonard , this is a violent and intelligent action film . The story : a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals . Roy Schieder does great job as the leading character and special credit 's got to go to John Glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath . I must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action film. also features some beautiful and sexy women - most notable are Kelly Preston as the young bate for Schieder 's character . Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers . I 'm glad to say that Ann-Margaret still hasn 't lost it - this lady is a true babe . Don 't look at the rate of this film . I really don 't know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under-rated film . You will enjoy it , that 's a promise . Recommended A + . , " positive
" A bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rapes a woman . He 's been shot by two policemen and then he is risen from the grave because of some sort of satanic ceremonial rite preformed by an evil heresy . The hunting of women continues by this zombie-demon . The sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the maniac dead again , but only with the help of the police this will come true ... A bloody 65-minute mess ... Horny zombies , doll-babies , S & M , corrupted and twisted policemen , repented heretics who seek refuge in front of Jesus Christ and three text-screens at the end of the film explaining us what finally happened to the policeman who survived ( yes , we ought to know ! ) ... Two decent disemboweling shots can 't save the situation . I 've seen worst horror-flicks , but this one was pretty bad too . Recommended only for the die-very-hard fans of the genre . , " negative
.... " and now I 'm up to episode # 7 . I really was hoping it 'd be over by now ( not to mention canceled , once everything connected with the show -including the actors - had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere , never to be seen again ) , because this series really is dire . To have this program listed under the genre of ' comedy ' is at best misleading ! It 's so hard to believe Ben Elton could write something this bad , maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he 's been connected with before . In some episodes I haven 't even laughed once ! Oh , and I can 't believe Ardal O 'Hanlon actually stopped doing ' My hero ' & started doing this instead , his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day - perhaps he simply can 't read , and didn 't realise just how poor the scripts for ' Blessed ' were . Don 't get me wrong , ' My Hero ' is not masterpiece , but it 's a million times better than this piece of junk.And just to annoy me even more I bet this gets a DVD release as well , when there are so many great TV series ' that aren 't getting released ! , " negative
" Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired ! ) and agree with many of the comments , that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on . Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied , so off I went to discover more . I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story . The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film , is ' real ' and down to earth . I hope you enjoy it . I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy . She is a singer ( aswell as dancer ) in her own right and I think this was the edge needed to create the character . Some other actresses may have struggled with this . It is ashame the film did not delve deeper into her story . After all this is the film title , but I felt we learnt more about Richard , but I suppose like any performer worth their salt , you should always leave them wanting more ! , " positive

" Man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy . Now most of the rest of the film was okay . It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing . Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others . The problem isn 't with direction , acting or anything technical . The movie is just destroyed in the third act . Why ? The murders , twists , turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL ? What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that ? The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history . For all the complaints about Burton 's Planet of the Apes , THe life of David Gale or Notorious I think THIS is the worst ending ever . What a let down . , " negative
" Talk about being boring ! I got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical Night on the Galactic Railroad . I expected to see crazy stories and hijinks of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such bizarre material . Boy , was I wrong.Spring and Chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation . It 's certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as NOTGR which is something that I suggest you watch instead . Leave this bore alone . If you absolutely MUST see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap . Do not pay top dollar . , " negative

" Personally , I disdain The Jerry Springer Show , however , I found " " Ringmaster " " to be the funniest movie I 've seen this year . The never-ending satire of Jerry Springer " " guests " " starting in the opening scene keeps you laughing throughout the movie .

" George Lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn 't . But this show is a work of art . It 's not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it ( and jokes that re memorable at that ) . This show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old , short drunk to an dyslexic teenager . I don 't know who writes this show but that person does a great job . If they had just continued the show I 'm sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country . If you are looking for a good , traditional comedy , then George Lopez is the show for you ! The one bad thing is the title . George Lopez ? Really ? Imagine the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air being " " Will Smith " . " C 'mon man ! But otherwise , this show is genius ! 10 / 10 , " positive
" I agree with so many of the other reviewers here . This was a great film and an even better novel by Robert Fish . Unfortunately , I believe the author died before he could see this film made . The performances are all top rate , with the three principles ( John Glover , Ben Cross , and Veronica Hamel ) seemingly made for their roles . The exteriors , both in Europe and Israel , seem very authentic , and the 4-hour miniseries length was just right for the telling of this story . Fortunately , I DID tape this when it was on television and have enjoyed watching it ever since . I can say unhesitatingly that it holds up even to this day . I gave it a rating of 10 . If you haven 't read the book , you should really find a copy . This would be an outstanding film to release on DVD with extras that could easily include interviews from the cast . , " positive
" I haven 't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time . I got to go to an advance screening , and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it . I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie . The audience all shared my laughter , and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie.Kudos to Steve Carrell ( who I had already been a fan of ) . He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy . He has a style that I haven 't seen before . And Catherine Keener is excellent as always . Thank God there wasn 't a cameo from Will Ferrell ( love him , but saw him too much this summer ) .There were parts of comedic genius in this movie . Partly thanks to Carrell , and partly thanks to the writing ( also Carrell ) . The waxing scene and the speed dater with the " " obvious problem " " were absolutely hysterical.I will definitely go see ' 40 Year Old Virgin ' when it 's released . My advice : go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it . , " positive

You 'd never know by watching it though . Script ? Are you kidding . Acting ? I think even the trees were faking . Cinematography ? Well , there must 've been a camera there . Period .

" There is a certain genius behind this movie . I was laughing throughout . The scene in the phone sex office , discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius / humor . Execution is poor , but you can see the writer 's message and they do have some talent . The doppelganger split at the end was like ... " " ok , wasn 't quite expecting that but let 's see what the movie has to say " . " Certainly ridiculous , but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way.Is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level ? i 'm easily bored by many movies , but this one kept my interest throughout.I think the story may have some auto-biographical roots , but that 's just a guess . Horribly bad , but good . I 'm looking for other movies this person may have done ( with more experience ) . , " positive

" This title seems more like a filming exercise than a film that should have been released to be seen by the public . For Dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time , without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it . I felt like it was 90mins wasted as I waited anxiously for a plot to develop , or even begin.Try to fit this film into a genre and you won 't , because it lacks a beginning , middle or ending . I 've seen ' arty ' movies before and this doesn 't even come close to being arty , abstract or original , it just seems to me to be completely pointless.I think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group . No doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was insistent on throwing at us . That is if you can call it erotic . It certainly didn 't have taste . , " negative
... " But not this one ! I always wanted to know " " what happened " " next . We will never know for sure what happened because GWTW was Margaret 's baby . I am a lifelong fan of Gone With the Wind and I could not have been more repulsed by the movie . I did compare " " Scarlett " " to the original GWTW because any film worth following GWTW needed to be on the same quality level as the first . Rhett was cast beautifully , although NO ONE will ever compare to Mr. Gable . I am also a strict Vivien Leigh fan ! ! She WAS Scarlett . She fit the bill . Not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with " " Scarlett " " the job could have been done better . Not enough thought went into finding the proper Scarlett , that was evident.Overall , something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to Scarlett and Rhett , I suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction .

" This movie is a crappy and forgettable Sean Connery vehicle . The performances are generally crappy especially by Capshaw , Fishburne , and the usually solid Ed Harris . Connery seems miscast as a Harvard Academic . The movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along . It is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels . The movie squanders an excellent supporting cast . George Plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to Connery as they debate the death penalty . The violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery / thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree . The scripting and direction are extremely poor . Connery 's charisma and screen presence are the film 's only virtue . Manipulative , Violent , and Ridiculous . 2 / 10 Avoid It . , " negative
" Are you kidding me ? This is quite possibly the worst , amateur movie I 've ever seen . The casting was horrible , the acting was worse than horrible and I 'm sorry , the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing Drew around was nothing more than comical . When I herd about the Bell Witch , I wanted to believe . I read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story . But this movie just destroyed that . Ric White ( Director , Writer , Lead Actor , etc ) takes himself a bit too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves ....

" I mean the word " " pedestrian " . " Seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen . Faith Domergue can do better than this . She is supposed to be the mysterious , vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson ( there 's an idea , eh ? ) . Instead she 's a common would-be housewife of the fifties , and the single , flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before Faith had her coffee . As for the rest of the cast , they are all so earnestly " " all-American " " that the result is laughable . This is ground more productively covered in Val Lewton in " " The Cat People " . " I think " " Cult of the Cobra " " should really be titled " " Cult of the Contractual Obligation " .

" People call this a comedy , but when I just watched it , I laughedonly once . I guess the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14 , and I wasn 't old enough to understand that it wasn 't meant to betaken seriously . There were quite a few scenes that were meantto be funny , but I cared too much about the characters to laugh atthem.I suggest that you watch this film next time you 're falling in love , and try to take it seriously . I think you 'll find that , despite a few sillyflaws , it 's one of the most moving love stories you 've ever seen . , " positive
" Maybe it wasn 't that good as a whole , but the second episode , which was the first one I say , was so memorable I still remember it today . I became a fan of Dick Francis . I would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and mysteries.The cockney slang of the sidekick , Chico Barnes , is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing London 's Bow Bells , but the leads are attractive and the shows were interesting.Sid Halley was one of Francis ' more interesting characters , and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand . Interestingly , electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after World War II . , " positive
" This program is certainly my favorite non-sitcom television comedy . Australia produces very little good programs - most of the TV which I watch ( and I live in Australia ) is from the US and England.The funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is . Like when they went past numerous security barriers at the APEC summit pretending to be Canadian diplomats.The show is made up of pre-filmed stunts , general satirical discussion of current world events , and sometimes on-stage skits . These all come together to make a fabulous , extremely funny TV show . The segments like " " Ad Road-test " " and " " Message from Osama bin Ladin " " are hilarious . For anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical TV comedy - then this is definitely the show you should watch.All the guys are great and do an excellent job in entertaining you for half an hour.I would rate it 10 / 10 . , " positive

Oh yeah OK it goes somewhere , but you see that coming from miles away . Acting : Really really bad , maybe the bartender was kind of OK . Editing : BAD ! I suppose the editor was told " " we need at least 90 minutes " , " cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin . Music : don 't get me started on that , the lousiest score I 've ever heard . Who is that singing in the last scene for crying out loud ? ?

" What is night vision ? Well according to the star ( Williamson ) let 's see ... one package store owner says to him ' it 's getting dark outside ' to which he replies ' it makes for better ......... ' night vision . ' What in the hell does that mean ? In fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say ? It has plot holes that you could drive the killer 's van through . Not to mention a cop on duty drinking , Robert Forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze , and a killer who videos his murders . That 's actually all I remember.The film took place in Texas , had a few car chases , and a clich챕d ending . Perhaps if one watches this film with their eyes closed - it might be good ? After all , without being able to see it .... it would make for better ..... night vision . Did that make sense ? Nope . And neither does this film . , " negative
" Being a HUGE fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film.I was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller-coaster ride ...... alas.Where to start on this mess ? i think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny.I was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing.Many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cut.The overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the ' terrible ' guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to run , but to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created.The acting , at times , is pathetic.Fenella Fielding is wasted as the loony Mrs Foxfur and i 've seen Simon Pegg have much better outings.I 'd recommend Guest House Paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much more.But to any bottom fan who hasn 't seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned , " negative
" How this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me . The only actor who is at all known to me is Judge Reinhold , an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production.I don 't even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award , this film really does make B movies a cinematic enjoyment . A car travelling along the freeway with police in tow , and no one knows how to stop the car , yeah , right.The script must have been written on the back of a cigarette carton . Most made for TV movies are awful but this redefines the word . Check out the acting skills of the bridge operator , pure Oscar material . , " negative
" Are we talking about the same movie ? This movie is totally ridiculous , the plot is disgusting and completely without logic . Its a typical straight to DVD / TV-movie including all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience : Over-acting by has been actors , side steps from the plot that are left unexplained , THE GIRL SHOWS HER T * ts ( why , god , why ? ? ) , people do not react to things as they would in real life . I 'm not even gonna bother you with details , it would take all night . Well , OK , just one : If two people were murdered in front of you as you were walking down the street , one of the victims practically dies in your arms , his blood spurts from his head-wound all over you , would your first concern be ; " " Oh , he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face !

" I love the first and third Beastmasters , but this one was an abomination . It was almost as horrible as ' The Never Ending Story 3 ' , for the same reasons . They took a fascinating fantasy world of Barbarian tribes , farming villages , witches , supernatural creatures , and a cult of religious fanatics using a pyramid ; and thought it would be funny to mix in our materialistic pop-culture world of rock & roll , sushi ( I think thats what it was ) , and flashy sports cars . These two worlds do not belong together . I do not want to see a bunch of ancient barbarian looking people dancing to some rock song on the car radio . I have a sense of humor , but this is just stupid . This is what Hollywood does to good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas . Don 't give up though , the Eye of Braxus is much , much better . That one I gave a 10 . This one , Portal of Time , I give a 1 . Believe me , I don 't always give such extremely high or low ratings . I just tend to comment only such movies . , " negative
" In the eighties , Savage Steve Holland put out three movies , two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre , absurdist teen comedies . The third " " How I Got Into College " " does not measure up to " " Better Off Dead " " and this one , mainly because of it 's lack of John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong ( Except for a tiny cameo ) .One Crazy Summer is an underrated movie , with lots of great characterizations and gags . As I recall , Savage Steve 's movies were vilified as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he drifted into children 's TV . We could use more movies from the likes of him . , " positive
" This is the best film version of Dicken 's classic tale . I 've seen it over and over on VHS , and recently acquired the DVD version , which is formatted for TV ( not wide-screen ) . What I find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of English actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films / shows in North America since 1984 . My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward , " " the Equalizer " , " as the Ghost of Christmas Present . , " positive
" I have to say that Higher Learning is one of the top 3 movies I have ever watched . It has a brilliant cast , and an equally brilliant director . Singleton shows how life in University can be . There are 3 main story lines , the skinheads , the African-Americans , and the homosexuals . I was intrigued by all of the stories , but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about Kristen , battling her feelings towards another girl . The end was great . After seeing the movie 25 times plus , I still cry . I would have given this movie an 11 , but I have to settlefor 10 / 10 . , " positive
" I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I have seen her grow over the years . The minute I saw her interact with Oprah , I predicted that this show would happen , because I saw how taken Oprah is with her , and with good reason : she comes across as very natural , and willing to laugh at herself , which is very engaging . The set is appealing , and there are some fresh ideas ( I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on ) . There 's just enough of a celebrity segment , and she stays away from controversy and debate ( there 's enough of that on daytime TV ) . The show is a lighthearted escape , and she hasn 't moved away from her strength ( cooking ) , which is very good planning . I know there are people who hate her and hate her show ; that 's OK , you can 't please everybody . And somehow , I think Rachael knows and accepts that . So just turn the channel ; I don 't think she 'd mind . , " positive
" Stay away from this movie at all costs . I was suckered into watching this movie in a bet to see which one of us knew the t " " worst movie of all time " . " Needless to say this one won hands down . It is long and drawn out , and has no purpose or plot from what I can gather . A movie about a killer kid raised from a fetus that was grown outside the womb just has no place inside your vcr . If you are extremely bored and have no life watch this movie . But if you rather keep your sanity , stay AWAY . , " negative
" WAIT until you 've watched most of all other films ever released , wait a year , then watch this when you 're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody 's imagination.I agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data . Anything above 8 would be odd.Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured , though she overdid the New Yorker accent but other times her southern ( Virginia & NC ) accent did sneak through . Ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film.The DVD I rented had two bonus features , a mini-bio section that only featured Sandra 's bio - taken verbatim from IMDb . It also had a Trivia Quiz as a bonus - 3 questions . Hope you get them all right ! , " negative
" Why ? Why ? Why on earth no one tells the truth about this horrible , HORRIBLE movie ? I still wake up in the morning and ask God why He didn 't stopped me from seeing this revolting " " comedy " . " I cant believe I PAID to see this offense to my cinematographic taste . I 'm starting to think that the 5 stars it has is because of Martha Higareda ' s nudity and all the men who cant buy a porn film and avoid seeing this ... I will call it " " thing " " cause call it film is an insult to the Mexican film industry . The characters are a huge clich챕 , the acting causes involuntary laugh and the script is ... well , I cant believe a human being wrote this . And just when you thought you 've been tortured enough ... the last half hour is so painful that I wished to ripped my eyes out . The only good thing I can say about this abomination is that it only last 90 minutes ( that would feel like centuries , but still ) . Really , AVOID THE PAIN ! ! ! , " negative
" I actually liked this movie until the end . Sure , it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon . Until the end , that is . For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students , what does the main character do ? Wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition ? No . She tortures and butchers the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable Brittany Spears-wannabe pop song . My ears bled ! And , in the supreme moment of horror , her teachers gave her a standing ovation ! Any teacher not in a Spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot . Save your time , save your ears - skip this movie ! , " negative
" badly directed garbage. a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest ... if you are the sort of person who likes that ... see a shrink. even if you are that person it doesn 't make this a good film , the acting is really poor , the story full of plot holes , the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one . I can see why people dislike uwe boll .. we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them , which is really sad ! A complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates . Horror films can be full of desolation , they can be miniature works of art , they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on ... SEED is just really really poor . , " negative
" This almost documentary look at an enterprising boy who lives in the body shop area outside of New York is real all the way . Real lighting . Real sound . Less editing in the whole movie than in 1 minute of most movies . And while there is very little script , there is a story . Shot in primary colors , almost all red , white , blue and yellow , we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing . He has a place to live that he makes his own , has a good job , and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe . The people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which I didn 't know about . They mostly seem decent and pay Ale what seems like daily , seeming truly concerned about his well being . The actor ( I think ) playing Ale says more with one facial expression than one can imagine . This reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish . It shows what kids are capable of , even without much support and love . Definitely recommend . , " positive
" Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling , dark , and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic ( Paxton himself ) who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders , claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but " " demons " , " and that they have been selected by God to destroy these " " demons " . " This is all told in flashback by one of the sons , now grown up ( Matthew McConaughey ) to skeptical FBI agent ( Powers Boothe ) .Hard to automatically forget this film ; better than most serial killer features , it 's a twisty and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks . Paxton , commendably , barely shows any blood at all until near the end . Well acted by all , especially the two child actors ( Jeremy Sumpter of the recent " " Peter Pan " " and Matt O 'Leary of " " Spy Kids 2 " " and " " Domestic Disturbance " " ) . The only reason I deducted any points at all is because I can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach . In any event , it 's an atypical thriller with a decent script.8 / 10 , " positive
" Being an American service member please believe me when I say that this movie in no way accurately portrays the emotional state of our Soldiers / Sailors / Airmen / Marines returning from deployments.That being said .... This movie is one large steaming pile of clich챕 . The acting as awful ( with the exception of the little girl ) the character 's backgrounds are weak and laughable , and plot is ludicrous.This movie is so bad I made an account with IMDb just to warn anyone with half a brain away from it.Canadian writer / director Francesco Lucente should be really , really , really ashamed of this movie . If he disagrees with US foreign policy , he should write a letter to the US government , not punish the entire English speaking world with a monumentally crap film . , " negative
" This movie is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost-story and suspense-thriller conventions , none of them fully realized and all of them rather irritating . The script was perfunctory . The acting , ditto . The scary FX were mostly laughable except for one exquisite seat-jumper moment that scared me even though I saw it coming a mile off . Now , explain to me someone why you would need ghosts , AND black magic , AND arcane ritual objects , AND Count Crapula CG boogeymen , AND psychic investigators , AND family curses , AND Irish superstitions , AND bowls of milk left out for the supernatural beings , AND possessed dollies , all in the same movie ? With all that you would expect more than one good moment of horror , but this movie is lame , lame , lame . , " negative
" This movie really kicked some ass . I watched it over and over and it never got boring . Angelina Jolie really kicked some ass in the movie , you should see the movie , you won 't be disappointed . And another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from The X-Files is in it , David Duchovny . , " positive
" This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre . I was happy to see William Powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm , and without the silly attitude of his Nick Charles character ( from the " " Thin Man " " series ) . While the story is good on its own , I think what really makes this movie fun to watch is Michael Curtiz ' fantastically imaginative direction . From a visual point of view , this is a richly textured movie , with Curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium ; from split screen images , to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks , Curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best Hollywood directors . Highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie . , " positive
" I purchased this movie on blu-ray because it promised great visuals and music . I was also a great fan of a similar movie ... Baraka . The movie is very much styled after Baraka , wide angles , very similar shots with cameras set to capture long time passage in each shot . Even some of the scenes were identical ( the street with traffic ) . Whereas Baraka told a great story , juxtaposing nature , man-made environments , spirituality , and horrors of the world in an engrossing fashion and great music , this movie just jumped from shot to shot with no encompassing story , mediocre musical score , and then .... POOF , it 's finished ! I thought there must be some sort of mistake ! History of the world ? Half the movie is Egypt and landscape ( looks like Arizona , but I didn 't bother to check ) . Seriously folks , this is horrible , rent it if you must , but do not buy it . The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this out . , " negative
" I know a lot of people have said don 't bother with this movie because its not a good fighting flick and hard with the subtitles . That is a really lazy way to think of a movie . If you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else , and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art , this being a masterful piece of work . If you want to watch this , its not about the fighting really . There are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work , but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part . This is not the basic Kung-fu movie . The story is really the central focus and not the fights , and the combination of the two make an excellent movie thats well worth watching , and is even better in the original language with subtitles . , " positive
" Unentertaining , uninvolving hybrid of " " Cruel Intentions " " and " " Wild Things " , " but it isn 't nearly as good as either of those trash min-classics . It 's about the acting sheriff , Artie ( Taye Diggs ) being called in to investigate a near-fatal drug overdose at a posh upper-class Univesity , but to keep it on the down low . As he digs deeper he thinks it 's much more than it at first glance seems to be . We follow Alicia , the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well . At about 90 minutes , if this film was welcomed to begin with , it would have worn it out . This film brings absolutely nothing new to the table . But it IS the only movie thus far that has Miss Swain topless so the grade is higher just for that.My Grade : DEye Candy : Dominique Swain gets topless ( fixing a mistake of " " Happy Campers " " ) ; another girl is topless Anti-Eye candy : more men ass than girl tit , " negative
There are few films that have had me waiting and waiting for release more than this one . This is the latest film from The Dead Gentlemen group responsible for the original Gamers film and the Demon Hunters films . This group has not been terribly active over the last few years but this film is a definite reason to try and keep things up in following their progress.This film follows a group of gamers who are trying to finish a campaign run by a GM frustrated by his group 's disregard for his story . With the help of some new blood they attempt the campaign again with hopes of finishing this time.This movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original . The movie shows respect for the game much like the original movie did but on top of that this movie shows a dramatic improvement on special effects launching it above the simplicity of college films . The acting is fairly decent and the jokes are quite funny.Unfortunately many of the jokes are in jokes so if you are not a gamer you may not find the film as funny as others . So this is why I give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that I initially thought of . Any case if you are a gamer or know about gaming check this one out you will enjoy it . , positive
" The only reason I decided to view this film is because of the great acting talents of Karen Sillas , ( Alyson Haywood ) , " " Bad Money " , " ' 99 , who is deeply involved with Gary Cole , ( Dave ) , " " Cry Wolf " , " ' 05 , who is a great war hero and has all kinds of ways to make money and never seems to stop telling LIES . Alyson and Dave are trying to rebuild an old home and restore it to comfortable living conditions . The relationship gets troublesome and Alyson decides to find out what is going on and the plot gets very mysterious . If you are a big fan of Karen Sillas , this is the film for you . I only wish Karen would appear in more films , I miss her great talents . , " positive
" Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10 . Sam Mraovich wrote , directed , stared , and produced this movie . Sam should have given his idea to a good writer , director , and left the acting to somebody who could act. this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production. there was nobody to tell him , " " Sam this is bad , really bad " . " Jamie Brett Gabel 's acting was the only good point , but he could have been so much better with a good director , and better actors to work with . This movie is so bad i think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie ( twice ) . the acting and direction was so bad , this movie was turned into a comedy. you just had to laugh , and in the wrong places . A second good point .... this would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date ! , " negative
" I 've lost count of the times I have seen this movie , but I love it and find it very funny each time I see it . The facial expressions , slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great . The characters , especially " " Nitro " , " " " Sonar " " and " " Stepanik " " are hilarious . I thought Kelsey Grammar , Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job . In fact , I think this movie was perfectly cast . I think it does need to be released in DVD before I wear my VHS version out . , " positive
" It may have been thrilling for an audience in 1946 , but the movie is now a bit boring . I had a hard time sitting through the whole thing , and it was very predictable : I mean , we know from the beginning of the movie that Welles is the nazi war criminal , and I 'll give you one guess as to whether he is caught and appropriately punished in the end.Not worth watching . It 's sad that Welles only made three movies worth seeing in his long career : Kane , Ambersons , and A Touch of Evil . , " negative
" " " Brotherhood of Satan " " is one of the most underrated horror films of all times.Why it hasn 't achieved a cult status is beyond me.This is a chilling tale of terror and witchcraft which contains one of the most powerful and disturbing climaxes in the annals of screen horror.In the small American town some children have disappeared and their parents been violently murdered.What is the cause of hysteria ? The film is really eerie , some scenes are genuinely unnerving and definitely not easily forgotten.The suspense never lets up , the acting is really good , and the climax is bizarre and disturbing.Check out this forgotten gem of satanic horror.Absolutely recommended . , " positive
" I went into " " The Closer She Gets " " knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker 's mother fighting cancer . I expected it to be a very harrowing , depressing movie . And although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching , the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends . It shows a family 's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together . They refuse to lose faith in each other , even in the darkest moments . The most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed . Little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her ( and their ) will to survive , and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness . In this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film . We should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness . , " positive
Gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality ... and to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as drama .... but I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years . Immensely sympathetic performance from Jared Harriss ( who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma ... hopefully without poor Richards penchant for hellraising and haminess ) .... and charming offbeat cuteness from costar Yu Xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer . Radiant location photography ( including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall ) and sensitive direction by Ann Hu give film added impact . In short a must for anyone ever enchanted by a shadow flickering to life ... and making magic in the dark . , positive
" I saw this film at its New York 's High Falls Film Festival screening as well and I must say that I found it a complete and awful bore . Although it was funny in some places , the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden , especially the " " Lovely Lady " " and the voice of the narrator ( whom I have never heard of ) had a lot to be desired . J.C.Mac was , I felt , the redeeming feature of this film , true action and grit and ( out of the cast ) the only real acting . I am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing , this could have been a half decent film . Let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release , or if you really want a copy , look in the bargain bin in Lidl . , " negative
" What do you expect when there is no script to begin with , and therefore nothing that the director can work with . Hayek and Farrell , and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors , they just don 't have anything to say or anything to react to . Even the earthquake was pretty poor . And I don 't know how closely the movie follows the novel , but two have the Jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that Arturo has a nice , warm heart , but some stereotypes don 't amount to anything . And he even buries Camilla out in the desert , instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while . Pathetic . And the L.A. set was ridiculously graphically created . Anything good ? The window to his apartment felt real , the curtains , the sounds , the wind . And Donaldson is always great . Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead , whichever it was . , " negative
" Veber is not renown for his outstanding directorial skills . In fact nobody cares as long as they got the laughs , quite a few here to be honest , scattered in the whole process , thanks to Depardieu 's half-wit characterization and the dialogue Veber puts in his mouth.But this is not enough to make a great comedy since there 's no movie outside of the usual Veber premise : a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character . In L 'Emmerdeur , La Ch챔vre or Les Comp챔res there was a real story going on over the fire vs. water proceedings . Le Diner de cons , although it was a play , managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe Pinon would cause . In Tais-toi the backstory about the vengeance is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest . Plus the heavies are lame both on screen and in the script.Now what 's wrong ? Veber wraps this up creating no action , no rhythm . Instead he uses systematically and overuses ellipses ( maybe he met William Goldman in Hollywood ) and the ' music ' really stresses that lack of nerve and a backbone in the story.So you 'll have to be content with Depardieu 's performance . , " negative
" A ridiculous movie , a terrible editing job , worst screenplay , ridiculous acting , a story that is completely ununderstandable ... If God was going to decide if movies should continue to be done , judging by this one , the entire world movie industry would now be dead ... A wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who " " think " " they can make movies.I am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour , and are never introduced to us ... , " negative
" The most hardcore bad film buff will be surprised by the overall ineptness of this grade-z " " film " . " Mary Woronov , a clever actress best known for her roles as Mary Bland in Eating Raoul and Miss Togar in Rock ' N ' Roll High School , is by far the best thing about this tripe . This film is almost too bad even for MST3K - honestly ! , " negative
" I went out of my way to get this film , and was fortunate to get it on VHS . Being a big Gloria Grahame fan , it was an excellent addition to my collection . Other than that , I really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture . The plot is predictable ( and weak ) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department . Ms. Grahame is always fun to watch ( if you like her , as I do ) , but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot . She works in a dive , so let her use her own voice . It can only lend to the atmosphere . I must agree with an earlier reviewer ; the ending borrows heavily from THE BIG HEAT . To the point of detracting from the ending . I have seen worse films with Ms. Grahame ( MACAO ) , but I will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen . If you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film , this is your movie . Enjoy the picture . , " negative
" This film launched my theory about films based on books : Instead of following the cliche " " You 've read the book ; now see the film , " " if you are looking for a good book to read , try one upon which a movie you like was based , because it 'll be 10 times better.I saw this film on its initial release at the National Theater in downtown Eugene and liked it so much that I stayed to see it again . It 's a perfect merger of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors , Jon Voight , with what became my favorite book , " " The Water Is Wide , " " by Pat Conroy.I can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life . Two tiny caveats : ( 1 ) The video suffers severely from pan-and-scan and deserves a letterbox version . ( 2 ) The title should be restored to the name of the book , a reference to one of the most touching , enigmatic songs ever written , " positive
" A wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond it 's initial liftoff . Based on a true story , one of the many " " small " " stories prior to WW II , that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures , impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes , with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon . Viewed at the Stony Brook Film festival , the film was enthusiastically received . Well written and expertly cast . The characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations . , " positive
" I rarely comment on films but I 've read the other comments and I cannot believe that there are people applauding this celluloid rubbish . I know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit ; poorly acted , badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along . I am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want . All I can say is it is a terrible film , the content is poor and offensive , the production is amateurish and I am glad they could not make a film like this legally today , " negative
" This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures . Sure , the effects are laughable , the story confused , but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun . I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in , it added to what little suspense was mustered . Give it a 3 . , " negative
" I originally saw this film years ago during Cinemax Friday after dark series ( back when the cable box was built like a keyboard ) , and it intrigued me . Even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted.The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very enjoyable.They have a good chemistry together & Miou-Miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking.A movie like this probably wouldn 't be made in these politically correct times ( at least not in the US ) , since it seems to sensationalize things like violence , robbery , & casual sex . This movie proves that with a talented cast & also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject.It saddened me to find out Patrick Dewaere committed suicide & in the near future I , ll will check him out with Depardieu & Miou-Miou in Get Out Your Hankerchief . , " positive
" Well it 's not often that we in the UK have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the Afro Caribbean community , the last example that I can remember was the underrated Babylon way back in 1980 . So I had high expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy , a film that has been touted as the British version of La Haine ! Well La Haine it is not ! I agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other British films of late , but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly.The film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in London , but I 'm concerned that film makers now use type-casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging . Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all , but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in London the only future is violence & tragedy , " negative
" This was shown on a premium channel , so I didn 't realise it was made for TV . Even so , I like some of the movies on lifetime ( Lifestyle here in UK ) , but this was awful . The family were so cheesy , " " Love you mum " " " " Love you even more honey " " Then after they were broken into for the second time , 10 mins later , they were at it again , " " Love you mum " " big cheesy smiles etc ... She phones her husband , and tells him not to bother coming home . They were only broken into by a guy that wanted them dead , have a nutter living next door , who needs help ? She has her teenage daughter and a cat ( not for long ) to look after her.However , as a comedy , I 'd give it a good 7 . I might even show it to my friends next time I have them round . Could be great fun after a bottle of Vodka or 10 ! , " negative
" This is the worst thing the TMNT franchise has ever spawned . I was a kid when this came out and I still thought it was deuce , even though I liked the original cartoon.There 's this one scene I remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are . It 's atrocious . Many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle , but that didn 't bother me . So much so that I didn 't even remember her until I read about the show recently . All in all , it 's miserably forgettable.The only okay thing was the theme song . Guilty pleasure , they call it ... Nananana ninja ... , " negative
" This is easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I 've ever seen . It utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth , inventing silly plot twists and reducing the 12 labours to ... 3 or 4 , I think . It makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers ' having ever read the myths , like changing birds to harpies , lions to sphinxes , the Oracle of Delphi to Tiresias , and bulls to a pedantic version of Proteus , even integrating aspects , never seen outside of Sam Raimi 's entertaining series , concerning his first marriage , to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the Furies so it sounds appropriate to the period.I could accept much of that , but it also fails completely in pure film standards ; most painful is the dialogue , leaden , portentous pseudo-Shakespearean tripe . It is a poor re-interpretation of the myths , making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that Crichton 's " " The 13th Warrior " " attempted in regards to the Beowulf legend , while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super-strength . A sad , sad failure of an entertainment experience , who I 'm sure many of the quality actors involved regret deeply . , " negative
" this move was friggin hilarious ! ! ! funniest I 've seen in a while , akshay and john kick ass as always , and the chicks are hot too. the story is awesome , lots of great jokes , and whoever reviewed this before me is an idiot. to him i say that u are not of Indian background so u wouldn 't understand the humor u moron. don 't rate movies u don 't understand. what did u watch , the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation ? thats what i thought jackass. akshay kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his versatility , he can do not only action but comedy as well , and is excellent at it. john has proved himself as well , this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it . , " positive
" Bette Davis brings her full trunk of tics to this miserable flop which is another variation on the " " hilariously mismatched " " lovers theme . Sadly , Cagney and Davis are truly mismatched in acting styles and the mix is not simply unpalatable but distasteful . The only distinction in the film comes from Eugene Pallette who , literally , phones in his usual part as the deb 's misunderstood dad . Jack Carson 's performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience , " negative
" I actually prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles ( e.g. Good Will Hunting , The Fisher King , The World According to Garp ) . These are my favorite Robin Williams movies . But Seize the Day , although well-acted , is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie ( even worse than Death to Smoochy , Club Paradise , and Alladin on Ice ) .Every good story is going to have its ups and downs . This movie , however , is one giant down . I don 't need a feel-good Hollywood cheese-fest , but I 've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness . This movie reminds me of " " Love Liza " " ( which is actually worse ) because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall . The answer ? Who cares . , " negative
" I happened to catch this movie on late night TV . I saw the opening credits and thought this looks good . Well I was very wrong . While not excruciatingly bad ( it had some funny and tender moments ) it lacked any sense of cohesion.It started off well enough with Kathy Bates 'character having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered . But Kathy has played these disaffected women so well before - think Fried Green Tomatoes . The problem wasn 't Kathy , it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place . It was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next . The script also felt very contrived.Some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it didn 't receive a cinematic release . The main reason I think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it.Having said all that I thought the small woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie , not to mention how beautiful she is . , " negative
" While it 's true that the movie is somewhat interesting , the execution leaves a lot to be desired ( much like Blood Orgy of the Leather Girls , I Spit on Your Grave , and Born in Flames , all superior ) . I don 't think it 's not porn , but porn is in the eye of the beholder : if it functions as porn for somebody , who am I to say that he / she is wrong ? I was rather puzzled by the statement in Winkimation 's generally thoughtful review ( " " Such a Shame " " ) that " " for once we actually see men 's faces when they come . " " A few years ago I did occasional freelance reviews for an adult mag and I recall seeing plenty of men 's faces when they came . I think this is probably more common when the film features on of the few male porn " " stars " " ( and especially when that male is the director ) . Though I unsurprisingly can 't refer to any specific titles , I know that there are some instances in Ron Jeremy 's , uh , work . I also don 't know that I 'd agree that a man is necessarily showing vulnerability in his face when coming . , " negative
" This is a very odd film ... I wasn 't really sure what is was about , some N London lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all , in their own way , change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster . The film ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied , almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all . I didn 't care about any of the characters - none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer.What was the message ? Am I being dim ? It was just too odd . What happens to Runner ? Why does Emilio shoot the kid ? ... that made absolutely no sense , pointless . Can someone help me understand this mess of a film ? , " negative
" I 've just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be . Toby Malone 's performance really stood out , I found myself actually caring about what happens to Matt throughout the whole of the film , which itself is a lot of fun , very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters , quite an achievement considering it 's short running time . There are plenty of good twists throughout as well , it will keep you guessing until the end . Other characters to watch out for are the totally insane Tiny and the sneaky attractive Jesse . It may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster but don 't let that put you off , you could do a lot worse than checking this out , you won 't regret it . Good Fun . 7 / 10 , " positive
" A good cast and they do their best with what they 're given , but the story makes no sense , the characters ' actions are inexplicable , and there are too many moments of unintentional humor , as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off . The scene when the two witch and her victim ( played by the same actress ) are in the house together sets up like a 3 Stooges routine , and the plot begs the question : if the witch wants to possess this other woman 's soul , why doesn 't she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase ? Not to be missed is Christopher Walkin 's eyeglasses and his automotive explanation of the afterlife ( paraphrased ) : " " The ancient Egyptianas - they wee materialists . They expected the body to last through eternity , like a used car that you souped up . But the Druids , they knew you couldn 't drive in the afterlife . You had to get out and walk . " " Huh ? The ending is absolutely indecipherable . Seems like they just ran out of film . , " negative
" This is the kind of movie you regret you put in your VCR . It is some weird bad rip off version of Stephen kings movie " " Misery ( 1990 ) " . " I cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score , because it has no story what so ever , and when the movie finally ended , I was relieved.This movie should have been released as a short-movie instead .. to much time is spent on the same thing . And as in every bad movie , everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span ... So , before you decide to watch this movie , be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control , because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding ... don 't worry , you wont miss anything important . , " negative
" OK , the show was a little uneven , but I still loved it . I found the main two bunnies annoying , but Hamton & Plucky were always amusing.I really want the Baby Plucky episodes on DVD ( or even VHS ) . Please release those !

" Eglimata ( = Crimes ) is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the absolute disaster.One of the smartest Greek series ever ! Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible ' guilty ' laughing.Every viewer seemed to recognise the bad side of their self in one of the characters or at least a side of their self they wish they had . Actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in Greek audience 's heart.My personal favourites ( apart the first two i mentioned ) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos , Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis but so many amazing actors passed by some episodes from time to time . Whoever around the world understands Greek should find a way to watch this series , even though it 's been more than 5 years that it was on TV.In Greece they keep repeating the series ( ANT1 ) in every chance there is like summertime or early afternoon zones.We 'll never forget Eglimata or any of the casting crew ! , " positive
" This was the only time I ever walked out on a movie . Years later , I saw it in the cable listings and thought , " " Maybe I should give it another try . " " Suffice to say that I was right the first time . This ranks second only to Godzilla 1998 as the worst movie I 've ever seen . , " negative
" " " D척 desu ka den " " is the first colored movie of Master Akira Kurosawa , and surprisingly is not about samurais , ronins , warlords or battlefields . It is inside a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo , where the dwellers are homeless drunkards , beggars , tramps , abused women , losers . I do not know the reason why Kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors , but indeed they are very sad stories , some of them heart-breaking . I personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them ; the story of the retarded boy that believes he pilots a train ; the story of the man that raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters ; and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather .

" I vaguely remember this film . I do remember it for the one solid reason that it is the only film that I have ever walked out on ! ! and since then I have never seen it available to rent ANYWHERE ! ! I can 't spoil it for anyone cos I can barely remember it ! ! To think , looking at the cast , it seemed a winner , with John Landis directing , but good god , they must have been paid a whole lot for this drivel ! ! All I can seem to recall is that the dad goes missing and the family try to search for him , by trying to put an actual photograph into the disc drive of a computer . I walked out after about half an hour of this . I must confess though , I 'd love to see if I can get a copy , just to see if it really was that bad ! ! It wouldn 't surprise me if this was on every actor 's black list ! I mean Christopher Lee was in this ? ? The legend of all bad guys , who 'd been in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings ? ? As I said - black listed movie , The Stupids ! , " negative
" A well cast summary of a real event ! Well , actually , I wasn 't there , but I think this is how it may have been like . I think there are two typically American standpoints evident in the film : ' communistophobia ' and parallels to Adolf Hitler . These should be evident to most independent observers . Anyway , Boothe does a great performance , and so do lots of other well-known actors . The last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable - and I mean it ! Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal . ( That 's why it 's so terrible - it all happened , and it probably looked just like that ) . But , actually , did that last scene on the air station really take place ? , " positive
" Gus Van Sant has made some excellent films . I truly am a fan.However , I can 't help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins book " " Even Cowgirls Get the Blues " " is lost in translation to the big screen . Alone , Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent . Ultimately though this one just didn 't work . It wasn 't that the characters weren 't well developed or the plot and content didn 't come alive . It 's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this . We 're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and / or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author 's precision . Movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience . This is what I believe happened here.I suggest reading the book ! , " positive
" I am a huge Shirley Temple fan . When I saw this movie , it made me appreciate what a talented child Shirley actually was . Ashley Rose Orr made possibly the worst on-screen Shirley . Imagine an 11 year old playing Shirley Temple from the age of 5 . That in itself is wrong . But getting her to ' mimick ' Shirley 's voice ? And her singing is woeful . The dancing was good , I 'll say that . As previous users have said , there was little dramatic scenes , nothing to make the story interesting . Not even Amelia Earhart ... I would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that Shirley Temple created . There was too much focus on the Wizard of Oz , when in reality , Shirley was just considered for Dorothy . The film portrays it as though it is the end of the world when she does not get the role . Shirley herself said that she is glad Judy Garland got to play her . For me the star of the show was the lady who played Gertrude Temple . Otherwise , stay away ! For great Shirley Temple films , watch Heidi , Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway . , " negative
" Jennifer Grey seems the unlikeliest of romantic leads and that 's probably the reason why this beloved film is such a sure-fire hit . It 's all very well doing a version of Montagus and Capulets with sweeteners like dancing and schadenfreude-baiting Jewish society family tropes thrown in but there usually has to be an X Factor.Swayze probably makes this film safe with his rugged , post-Travolta moves and temperament but its being won over by this curly-mopped Penelope Pitstop teen that brings the dream in reach of the impressionable market . The super ( dated ? perhaps ' immortalised ' ) soundtrack helps and of course the cunning conceit of setting the film in a resort away from day to day life altogether finesses the fantasy . 7 / 10 , " positive
" I just saw this movie today with my children ( son , 10 and daughter , 4.5 ) at the 3rd Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival . After the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the Director , Tian-Ming Wu . He ( through a translator ) told several stories about his life and the making of the film.All tangents aside , both of my children really enjoyed this movie . Of course , I had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter , but much of the film is visually self-explanatory.I won 't give anything away , but the bottom line is that this film is SO MUCH better than 95 % of the Hollywood crap ( especially children 's films ) out there.Cheers.p.s. There is a " " real " " / original King of Masks who can / could do 12 masks at once . The actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time ( then they would cut and change to 4 new masks ) . , " positive
" I bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous , over the top , entertaining bloodbath . I got none of them . This film fails on practically every level , not in the least frightening , or funny , it is simply terrible film-making , and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing . What is so bad about it is that far from being as raw , violent and brutal as it had promised to be , there is very little violence at all . Virtually no blood shed , and no excitement whatsoever . Acting , direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable . Honestly , it is truly laughable . I could hardly sit through this total garbage once ; I certainly will never want to watch it again . Don 't waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this ; it is truly possibly the worst film ever made . If I could give it minus stars , I would . , " negative
" Oliver Stone hits the bull 's eye with this film , aided chiefly by Bogosian 's electrifying screen presence and biting , brilliant screenplay . Every moment crackles with a steadily-growing tension , climaxing in a truly , memorable movie-going experience . If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director 's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity , then this is it ! The result is a powerhouse achievement , made more timely now perhaps because of our culture 's disturbing fascination with celebrity , and it 's distorted interpretations of fame.An ultimate indictment of our society 's increasing morbidity , and self-sickening hunger for the next big thrill.A film not easily forgotten . I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature . , " positive
" Low budget mystery . A shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction . A young architect Jimmy McMillan ( Chick Chandler ) discovers a dead body that goes missing . The woman in a hurry , Mary ( June Clyde ) , is linked to the death scene ; but it is McMillan that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion . Suspects are six shop owners in the vicinity of the crime scene . All the atmosphere of Film-Noir ; but not quite the real thing . This flick musters just enough to be a decent low budget mystery / drama and is a nice little escape . Other players include : George Meeker , Michael Raffetto , Milton Wallace and Rebel Randall . , " negative

But ex-teammate Reno Hightower ( Kurt Russell ) isn 't just going to go along with it so easily.Granted , it 's not the best movie for either man . But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team . And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles ( to say the least ) . Check it out . , " positive
" this movie is similar to Darkness Falls , and The Boogeyman ( 2005 ) but it 's also much more graphic than both , and not as good as either.it 's also slow and fairly predictable.it 's also got shades of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror.plus , we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational / inspirational sermon.really , this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything.even though it is gory , the makeup effects are not very realistic looking.in fact they look kinda cheap.aside from all that , there is some really awful clich챕d dialogue.and i won 't say when , but there is a point where a couple of the character 's actions were not authentic or believable , given the circumstances.nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way.once you watch the movie , you 'll know what i mean.there 's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity 's sake.it just wasn 't necessary at all.the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good.better than this movie deserves.so , after carefully weighing the evidence , id say this movie was passable , but not good.my verdict for The Tooth fairy : 4 / 10 , " negative
" As with the other episodes in this made-for-TV series expanding on the many adventures of the sea legend , Horatio Hornblower 's super human infallibility ruins all chance for suspense.As little Wesley Crusher ruined many seasons of THE NEXT GENERATION , Horatio Hornblower invincibly saves every situation . Each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of Horatio Hornblower . Immeasurably superior , Hornblower 's main trouble in this movie series seems to be tolerating the many error ridden characters above and below him in the chain of command . A perfect being makes for dull story telling . So superior is our hero , that even those who attempt to help him are powerless to do something correctly unless Hornblower is there to direct and control their every move.What is the sense in telling a story about any person who cannot do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every single time ?

" I was truly and wonderfully surprised at " " O ' Brother , Where Art Thou ? " " The video store was out of all the movies I was planning on renting , so then I came across this . I came home and as I watched I became engrossed and found myself laughing out loud . The Coen 's have made a magnificiant film again . But I think the first time you watch this movie , you get to know the characters . The second time , now that you know them , you laugh sooo hard it could hurt you . I strongly would reccomend ANYONE seeing this because if you are not , you are truly missing a film gem for the ages . 10 / 10 , " positive
" I just got done watching The Edge of Love ( by the way , this is one of the worst titles so far this year ) and it felt like a chore . Watching Keira Knightly 's unlikable , skeleton-looking character made me cringe even more throughout the coarse of the film.It took me four nights to watch this it was so boring . The only good thing about it was Cillian Murphy . He 's always good / believable and is severely under looked in many films . This , however , was just not good enough for him.Apart from the unlikable characters , boring storyline , the plot was also emotionally unsatisfying . I felt like I spent my time watching this for nothing ( which I did ) . I should have done the smart thing and turned it off , but I kept it on out of respect for Cillian Murphy and the great cinematography . , " negative
" I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show . I still vividly remember the film , especially the performance of Robert Taylor . I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid , almost dull leading man type , and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks . This film , however , proved what an interesting actor he could be . He did not get enough roles like this during his long career . This is his best performance . He is totally believable in a truly villainous role . From what I have read , he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles . He basically would just do what MGM gave him . This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles . The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolan 's character was . Nolan was a great actor , but this character really aggravated me . The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years . This film is definitely worth a look . , " positive
" This a fascinatingly awful movie . It make so little sense that it starts to make a kind of weird internal logic of its own . Well , it would if it didn 't keep darting off up side-alleys until eventually floundering under the weight of its own indecisiveness . The movie can 't make up its mind whether it is a straight forward ' Man Turns Into Monster ' flick ( like all those 1950s ' THE INCREDIBLE insert verb ING MAN ' movies ) , or a ghastly big business conspiracy theory movie , or a mystical afterlife contact story , or ... or what ? Take your pick . It 's just a mess . Grotesquely over the top and firing off in all directions , leaving loose ends flapping all over the place . It was as if Tobe Hooper had been taking David Lynch pills . Unfortunately he didn 't take enough . , " negative
" This solid black and white slapstick comedy with a dark ( but hopelessly contrived ) plot is a true crowd pleaser that will have you howling with laughter ( as well as rolling your eyes with disbelief ) .It 's the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson . His hapless , nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals Chevy Chase.The thing about the film that appealed to me the most , however , is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train travel . They add a most welcome sense of realism and recognition.This thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its " " suspense " " from Hitchcock and should , in my opinion , only be watched for its comedy value ( which is high indeed ) . Besides Gustafsson , Lars Amble 's solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone.Heartily recommend . , " positive
Don 't get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot . I love the series as well as the movies but enough already re : Death On The Nile . Everyone has done this one ! We know who dies . We know why they die . We know who the killer is . We know how it was done . So I say enough already ! Mr. Suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of Agatha Christie 's novels . I will say that the acting by all the actors was superb . The sets were terrific and very realistic . I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised at how ' awful ' he looked . I hope he doesn 't look that way in ' real ' life ! I honestly can 't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same . Somehow I don 't think so . I thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not Ms. Christie wrote it that way . I would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison ! , negative
" This movie is awful . At first I thought it may appeal to children , due to the cuddly Ewoks , the fury little people from Stars Wars . After sitting through this monstrosity of a movie , I am certain that not even a 4-year-old would find this movie interesting . The special effects are by far the best of this movie and compare well for other 80ies TV movies . The script is bad , the actors , especially Aubree Miller and unbelievably bad and the flick is so predictable that I still can 't believe I was able to not touch the forward button on my VCR .

Glorious scenes , wonderful cinemtrophy and a cast you want to eat with your heart . I found this to be one of this years most orchestrated powerhouse films and with reason .

" Now , I 'm one to watch movies that got poor reviews , and say , " " Hmm ... this isn 't so bad ! " " I loved The Cable Guy , and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great . Keep in mind , I really didn 't start watching this with high hopes , but I figured that maybe ... just maybe ... it would be bad in a kind of way I could laugh at it . I was wrong . At no point at all during my suffering through this " " film " " ( And I use that term sparingly ) was I even close to being mildly entertained . To start , Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting . I hate rap music , but as far as I could tell , an Amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him . The main character is simply annoying , and not a character that it 's easy to like . Quite frankly , I would rather eat a greasy turd out of a Harlequin fetus ' bloody sores than watch this again . , " negative

" Quite simply the funniest and shiniest film-comedy of all time ... it 's certainly on my personal top-ten list . This one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale . Millionaire heir , Arthur Bach ( Moore ) , is a middle-aged ' child ' who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite responsibilities . He also refuses to leave the bottle . One day he and his personal butler , Hobson ( Gielgud ) , go shopping at Bergdorf Goodman 's and run into petty larcenist , Linda ( Minnelli ) . Arthur and Linda 's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film . There are hilarious set pieces aplenty . In one such scene , Arthur ( drunk throughout most of the story ) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human ' siren ' ( " " My husband has a gun ! ! ! ! ) . Performances by everyone involved should be duly noted : Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur 's loving-yet-ruthless grandmother , Sir John Gielgud almost steals the entire show with his acidic droll-isms ( He took home the Oscar for this one ) , and Christopher Cross provides the Main Theme song ( Oscar winner " " Best That You Can Do " " ) . It 's a shame the late Dudley Moore passed away last month ( March 2002 ) . , " positive
" This was directed by Ruggero Deodato , a true icon to many horror film fans after he directed the seminal and notorious Cannibal Holocaust . However , don 't expect to find any such notoriety in the film reviewed here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like a Conan inspired outing for a young audience.Such a description may instantly put off most fans of the whole Conan inspired Sword & Sorcery genre but before you turn your nose up at this , it has to be said , this movie is just so much fun ! It 's mostly played for laughs and features two HUGE and highly likable heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. the Barbarian Brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters.B-Movie favourite Richard Lynch turns up as the main villain in the piece and it 's also great to see roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman.Added to this , the ladies are stunning to behold and suitably scantily attired throughout the films duration ( a staple and much welcomed ingredient in the genre ! ) What can I say , - this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre and I recommend it wholeheartedly ! , " positive
" Deep SH .. is more like it ! The eels are just cartooned in over the film . Think " " The Incredible Mr. Limpet " " meets " " Leviathan " . " Very tacky.No character or relationship development .

" This film is a perfect example of great escapism ! I loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning . Sure it 's just an action flick , but isn 't having fun what watching movies is all about ? The cast of this film are very strong with likable characters . The friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing , it 's heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact - especially this group of boys ! !

" If you are a fan , then you will probably enjoy this . If you don 't know who Misty Mundae , Darian Caine , Ruby LaRocca , or Seduction Cinema are , this is not the movie to start out with . It 's very cute , silly , the girls are hot , and it 's fun to watch . There 's no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film , but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot 's not a total bore . Misty Mundae 's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids , so she 's not as hot in this as she has been in others . But her panties in this are quite cute ( you 'll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird ) . If you do like this one , you will probably enjoy " " That 70 's Girl " , " " " Vampire Vixens " , " or " " Erotic Survivor " " ( which is a bit more sexually graphic ) . If you prefer watching Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual , more horror / exploitation-based ( but lower budget ) movies , check out the Factory 2000 website . , " positive

Jackie Mason shows the saying that " " less is more " . " He is funny , but a man with real family issues , a more rounded person . It 's no drama , but a movie that makes you feel .

I love it when Ham Salad 's sidekick / co-pilot tries to eat Princess Anne Droid 's cinnamon hair buns , and the Darph Nader character is just hilarious ! This film would be great to watch back-to-back with " " Thumb Wars , " " and I sincerely wish there could have been a " " Hardware Wars , Episode II : The Umpire Strikes Out . " " ( Was there ? ) , " positive
" The Return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time . Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout the movie . I was willing to put up with this , however I was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks . At the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young . Or maybe I 'm wrong and that was just a flashback . With this movie it 's impossible to tell . Can you believe the same dude who made Army of Darkness produced this crap ? A much better idea is to stay at home and watch Army of Darkness on Sci Fi channel . That movie had it all : sluts , zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for an arm . The Forgotten didn 't even have one of these things . , " negative
First of all that I would like to say is that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee is looking much better than before XD ! This is probably one of the most original movies I have seen so far ; shows a poverty lifestyle background of a Cambodian . The Cambodian ( Edison aka Pang ) goes around killing people to survive himself ; has done it throughout his entire life . Sam Lee 's ( Wai ) duty is to capture the Cambodian for good . There are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it . The movie shows the struggles between those two characters ; they both beat each other like angry dogs . GO AND WATCH PPL ... STRONGLY SUGGESSTED ! ! ! ( GO HK FILMS ) , positive
" How could 4 out of 16 prior voters give this movie a 10 ? How could more than half the prior voters give it a 7 or higher ? Who is voting here ? I can only assume it is primarily kids -- very young kids . The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way . The story is stupid ; the acting is hard to even think of as acting ; the characters are characterless ; and the dialogue is terrible . I saw this one rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel . In the sad event that it is ever rebroadcast , I suggest you read a book instead . , " negative
" Let 's see , cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped . You 'll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts ! Turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world .... the world of religious fantasy ! --complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of Papier Mache . Everybody gets dragged off to Hell except for one poor chap who goes to Heaven where he can presumably spend Eternity with the blockheads that created this Masterpiece of the Absurd . I think I 'd opt for Hellfire myself . Go see something else , unless you are stoned , in which case , you might actually like it ! Couldn 't hurt ! , " negative
" One of my favourite films first saw it when I was about 10 , which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour . Although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it . Expect to see the usual Askey & Murdoch banter so popular in its day , with lots of interesting , quirky co-characters . The lady with the parrot , the couple due to get married and are in trouble from ' her ' , and my favourite , the stationmaster , " " Nobody knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where it goes .. " " Interestingly the ghost train was written by Arnold Ridley of Dads Army fame ( Private Godfrey the medic ) Watch it on a rainy Sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile . , " positive
" The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors , the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances . This typical rising-star musical has an overworked plot , even for 1944 , but because of the actors it 's still fun to watch . Hayworth isn 't even that much of a dancer , but she has a lot of ' inexperienced ' charm that fits her character . Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while Silvers provides plenty of self-deprecation and laughs . The movie can also be very serious at times . Not a must-see , but recommended if you like the actors . , " positive
" obviously has some talent attached , Maria Bello is always great. but this is just a dreary wast of time , portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an ' interesting ' story. well , i hope they got it out of their systems. unfortunately for the audience , there is no insight , no sensitivity , no context , and really no humanity. which would all be fine , except it has no humor , no horror , no context , and nothing constructive to say about the story it 's trying to tell. bad things happen , you sit and watch it , you don 't care , so what ? 99 % of the time , the words ' based on a true story ' constitute an unintentional warning to the audience. it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere , so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the ' true ' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work. i hope they had a great time making this movie. it stinks on ice . , " negative
" A lot of the user comments i have seen on the IMDB for this movie don 't really do it justice . First of all , let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously . It 's supposed to be a fun , yet stupid movie , that doesn 't require one to think , only to enjoy it . If you watch this movie with the intent to see a masterpiece in either filmmaking or in humour , then you will be sorely disappointed . Yet , if you want to just watch a goofy movie with some talented actors / actresses , and some good catch-phrases , then you will enjoy it . , " positive
" Dolelemite ( 1975 ) is a cult classic . Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the MAN along the way . He has two enemies , that no good Willie Green and the sleazy mayor . Watch Dolemite kick , punch , slap and pimp his way across the screen . What 's the man 's name ? DOLEMITE ! Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers . To sell more of his party albums , Rudy Ray Moore made several on the cheap films during the seventies . Self produced and marketed he catered towards a specific audience . Some people call it blacksploitation others call it trash , I call it entertaining . Dolemite was followed by the semi-sequel The Human Tornado and a direct to video Return of Dolemite 25 years later.Highly recommended , a definite cult classic ! Footnotes , if the film was properly matted on video you wouldn 't see the boom mikes . Dolemite was cut to receive an R-rating . , " positive
" In Iran , women are officially banned from men 's sporting events . In June 2005 , the Iran 's national soccer team has an important game against Bahrain in the Azadi Stadium for the qualification of the World Cup . A group of Iranian girls and lovers of soccer dresses like boys and unsuccessfully attempts to enter in the stadium being arrested.Soccer ( and Flamengo 's team ) , beach and movies are my greatest passions ; therefore I loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for soccer . The director Jafar Panahi , from " " The White Balloon " , " " " The Mirror " " and " " The Circle " , " shot this movie on the day that Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified to the World Cup in Germany . The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most delightful movies I have ever seen . My vote is nine.Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available , " positive
" Nora is a single mother-of-two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s , as do her friends , a group of writers , singers and actors . The 혩free love ' philosophy isn 't quite out of the system 혯 and Nora didn 't count on falling in love , particularly with a junkie . Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI Awards in the space of four years for her amazing portrayal of Nora , who makes sure she does the right thing by her children , but falls in love with junkie Javo ( Friels ) at the same time . Garner 혯 who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET 혯 is well-cast as Nora 's pre-pubescent daughter , and Caton ( perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000 ? ? ? ) appears as a bearded painter . Early effort by director Cameron is a winner ; he went on to make the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects . But it 's the stunning delivery by Hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent , searching script , based on Helen Garner 's award-winning novel . , " positive
" okay , but just plain dumb . Not bad for a horror / comedy film . I was reading how people switched it with the Michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe ( never seen it ) the horror ( possibly comedy ) uncle Sam , i 'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on VHS of Amazon and got it November 21 , the day before thanksgiving. worth the four bucks , l.o.l. at this film.9 / 10 , " positive
" " " Bread " " very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and " " Night of the Living Dead " " in specific and is constantly inventive . The production values are a little rough at times ( it 's a student film , after all ) , but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain . Hey -- George Romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered " " Dead " " video tape , laserdisc and DVD ... that should tell you something . , " positive
" I watched this series after I had seen the Naked Gun films . I found it much better than the films , and I thought the films were great ! This series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun , sight gag , or funny situation ( the all night wicker place , club flamingo ) . I don 't think I 've ever laughed as hard at a TV series in my life , even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes . I think its a shame that only six episodes were produced , but I agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes . Overall , the series is a must see for those who like puns , bad jokes , and slapstick sight-gags . , " positive
" I rented this thinking it might be interesting , and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner . Hard to follow , strange editing , disjointed storyline , the characters mumble , all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time . I just couldn 't get into it and didn 't care what happened to the characters - not even Ian Holm could save this film . Unless you need a cure for insomnia , I 'd skip it . 3 / 10 , and that 's being generous . , " negative
" This is another typical unbelievable and non-sensical piece of Hollywood dreck.Kurt Russell , as Snake Pliskin in a business suit , convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman . Ray Liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd . Madeline Stowe is her usual cardboard self , and does little to be a convincing victim.Every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when Kurt clouts Ray with a vase or something , knocking him down and out . Kurt and Madeline then do their obligatory end-of-the-movie embrace , and EVERYBODY--- except Russell and Stowe , KNOWS Liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple again.He does , of course , and Russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm , which was ENTIRELY unnecessary . This movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning scene--- EXCEPT Hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence , and the more they can add , or " " enhance " , " the more slobbery they get . , " negative
OK when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group I was with . Now living in America especially during this election I see some very deceiving things but I have to say these previews were towards the top of list . I don 't see how so many people could be scared by this movie . I only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one . The whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me . As for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of I thought they were comical at best . Oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why ? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning . How does that scare someone ? I can make that noise easily . Now don 't get me wrong I have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but I didn 't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad . , negative
